      <p>Notes provided by Professor Armando Beltran (CSULA)</p>
      <p>This is an extension of the <a href="ai.html" target="_blank">artificial intelligence</a> and <a href="ml.html" target="_blank">machine learning</a> resources. Well, we’ll see where this goes — I’m writing this as the class goes.</p>
      <h2 id="whatisit">What's the Problem?</h2>
      <p>As computer scientists, we aim to develop and use AI to solve problems optimally. But before we look at how AI works, we should start with understanding what types of problems exist and how to define them.</p>
      <h3>Black Box Model</h3>
      <p>Some problems can be reduced to a "black box" model. The "black box" model has `3` components: an input, a model (algorithm or function), and an output. If one of the three components is unknown, then that is a problem we can define and solve.</p>
      <div class="ln-center">
        <img class="img-fluid ln-image-small" src="../pictures/ai2/black_box_model.png">
      </div>
      <h4>Optimization</h4>
      <p>If the input is unknown, then we have an optimization problem. As the name implies, optimization problems seek to maximize or minimize a result.</p>
      <p>For example, we’re traveling and we want to visit a bunch of destinations while minimizing time traveled, i.e., we want an efficient route so that we don’t waste time. The model is a function that calculates the time it takes to go from one destination to another. The output is a number representing the total time traveled (we want to minimize this). The input — which is what we want to solve for — is a route.</p>
      <div class="ln-center">
        <img class="img-fluid ln-image-small" src="../pictures/ai2/optimization_1.png">
      </div>
      <p>Another example is the `8`-queens problem. We want to place `8` queens such that no queens are attacking each other. The model is a function that calculates how many queens are attacking each other. The output is the number of queens attacking each other (we want to maximize this). The input — which is what we want to solve for — is a configuration of `8` queens.</p>
      <h5>Objective Function</h5>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, optimization problems aim to maximize or minimize a result. That result is calculated by a function, namely an objective function. An objective function is a math expression that quantifies the quality of a potential solution to an optimization problem. (The quality of a solution is how well it solves the problem.)</p>
      <p>In other words, an objective function assigns a numerical value to an input, and that numerical value is a measure of how good that input is as a solution to the problem.</p>
      <h4>Modeling</h4>
      <p>If the model is unknown, then we have a modeling problem. In these types of problems, we have the inputs and outputs, and we want to know what type of model fits the data.</p>
      <p>Let’s say we have these inputs and outputs:</p>
      <div class="ln-center">
        <table class="table">
          <tr>
            <th>x</th>
            <th>y</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>`1`</td>
            <td>`2`</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>`2`</td>
            <td>`4`</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>`3`</td>
            <td>`6`</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>`4`</td>
            <td>`8`</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>`5`</td>
            <td>`10`</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p>In this case, we can figure out that the model is the function `y = 2x`.</p>
      <p>A real-world example is voice recognition. We have the inputs (a set of spoken text) and the outputs (a set of written text), and we want to build a model that can match the spoken text to the written text.</p>
      <div class="ln-box">
        <p>Modeling problems can be transformed into optimization problems by picking a model that works and then optimizing that model.</p>
      </div>
      <h4>Simulation</h4>
      <p>If the output is unknown, then we have a simulation problem. These types of problems are like exploring "what if" scenarios.</p>
      <p>For example, predicting the weather is a simulation problem. The inputs are data points for things like humidity and temperature. The model is a function that takes in those data points and returns a weather. "What if it is humid and hot?"</p>
      <h3>The Search for Answers</h3>
      <p>Honestly, simulation problems don’t really sound like "problems" at all. All we need to do is run the model on the inputs and get our answer.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, for optimization and modeling problems, we have to search for something. For optimization problems, we have to <em>find</em> the input that gives us the desired output. For modeling problems, we have to <em>find</em> the model that gives us the desired output for the given inputs.</p>
      <p>Formally, there is a search space, which is a set of objects of interest, including the desired solution. It can typically be represented as a search tree.</p>
      <div class="ln-center">
        <img class="img-fluid ln-image-small" src="../pictures/ai2/search_space.png">
      </div>
      <p>For the time-efficient traveling problem, the search space is a bunch of possible routes and we have to find one that is the most time-efficient. For the voice-recognition problem, the search space is a bunch of models and we have to find one that is the most accurate.</p>
      <p>Typically, the search space for any problem will be very large, so we need an efficient way to explore the search space for the desired solution. A problem solver does this for us. A good problem solver goes through the search space and finds the optimal path through the search tree to the desired solution.</p>
      <h3>NP Problems</h3>
      <p>Some problems are inherently hard for computers to solve. This could be because it takes a really long time and/or a lot of memory is needed to find the solution. The difficulty of a problem can be classified into four categories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Class P: problems that can be solved in polynomial time</li>
        <li>Class NP: problems that can be verified in polynomial time
          <ul>
            <li>the "N" stands for "nondeterministic"</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Class NP-complete: a problem `p` is NP-complete if every other NP problem can be transformed/reduced to `p`
          <ul>
            <li>if it turns out that an NP-complete problem can be solved in polynomial time, then all NP problems can be solved in polynomial time</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Class NP-hard: problems that are at least as hard as NP-complete problems, but the solution may not be verfiable in polynomial time</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="ln-box">
        <p>These classifications (except for NP-hard) apply to decision problems: problems that have a "yes" or "no" answer. For example, "Is `A rarr B rarr C rarr D` the optimal route?"</p>
      </div>
      <h2 id="nqueens">The `N`-Queens Problem</h2>
      <p>The `n`-queens problem is an optimization problem that involves placing `n` queens on a chessboard such that none of the queens are attacking each other. For example, for `n=4`:</p>
      <div class="ln-center">
        <img class="img-fluid ln-image-smaller" src="../pictures/ai2/4_queens.png">
      </div>
      <p>To formalize things, we can frame the problem statement as, "Given `n` queens, find a configuration for the queens on an `n xx n` chessboard that maximizes the number of pairs of non-attacking queens."</p>
      <p>If we label the top-left corner as row `1`, column `1`, then we can represent a board configuration using coordinates. So for the example above, we have</p>
      <div class="ln-center">
        <p>`Q = {(2,1), (4,2), (1,3), (3,4)}`</p>
      </div>
      <p>The objective function `f` can be represented as</p>
      <div class="ln-center">
        <p>`max_Q f(Q) = (n(n-1))/2-A(Q)`</p>
      </div>
      <p>where `A(Q)` is the number of pairs of attacking queens for a board configuration `Q`.</p>
      <div class="ln-box">
        <p>`A(Q)` is the number of <em>pairs</em> of attacking queens (as opposed to the number of queens being attacked). In this example, there are `4` pairs of attacking queens.</p>
        <div class="ln-center">
          <img class="img-fluid ln-image-smaller" src="../pictures/ai2/4_queens_2.png">
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="ln-box">
        <p>`(n(n-1))/2` is the number of total possible pairs of queens. If we subtract the number of pairs of attacking queens from that expression, we get the number of pairs of non-attacking queens (which is what we're trying to maximize).</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Free Optimization Approach</h3>
      <p>Now that we have formally defined the problem, we can start to look at how hard this problem is to solve. For optimization problems, the difficulty depends on the size of the search space. The more inputs there are to search through, the harder the problem is.</p>
      <p>So how many possible board configurations are there? We'll first consider the `n=4` case.</p>
      <p>For the first queen, there are `16` spaces for where it can be placed. For the second queen, there are `15` spaces. For the third queen, there are `14` spaces. For the last queen, there are `13` spaces. So there are a total of `16*15*14*13=43,680` possible board configurations.</p>
      <div class="ln-box">
        <p>In general, there are</p>
        <div class="ln-center">
          <p>`(n^2!)/((n^2-n)!)`</p>
        </div>
        <p>possible board configurations.</p>
      </div>
      <p>For a standard `8xx8` chessboard, there are `1.78 xx 10^(14)` possible board configurations. Yeah, that's a lot to search through.</p>
      <h3>Constrained Optimization Approach: Row Constraint</h3>
      <p>Is it possible to make the search space smaller? Well, notice that if more than `1` queen is on the same row, then they're automatically attacking each other.</p>
      <div class="ln-center">
        <img class="img-fluid ln-image-smaller" src="../pictures/ai2/4_queens_3.png">
      </div>
      <p>So any board configurations where there is more than `1` queen in the same row can be removed from the search space. We can achieve this by reframing the problem statement as, "Given `n` queens, find a configuration for the queens on an `n xx n` chessboard such that <strong>every row contains exactly one queen</strong> while maximizing the number of pairs of non-attacking queens." We're introducing a constraint on the original problem.</p>
      <p>Also, instead of using coordinates to represent a board configuration, we can use a vector representation.</p>
      <div class="ln-box">
        <div class="ln-center">
          <p>`Q = [Q_1, Q_2, ..., Q_n]^T`</p>
        </div>
        <p>where index `i` represents the row number and `Q_i` is the column number.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="ln-center">
        <img class="img-fluid ln-image-smaller" src="../pictures/ai2/4_queens.png">
        <p>`Q = [3, 1, 4, 2]^T`</p>
      </div>
      <p>By using a vector, we force all possible board configurations to have exactly `1` queen in every row.</p>
      <p>Let's see how much the search space has been reduced by with this new constraint. Again, we'll first consider the `n=4` case.</p>
      <p>The first queen can only be placed in the first row, and in the first row, there are only `4` spaces for it. The second queen can only be placed in the second row, and in the second row, there are only `4` spaces for it. The third queen can only be placed in the third row, and in the third row, there are only `4` spaces for it. The last queen can only be placed in the fourth row, and in the fourth row, there are only `4` spaces for it. So there are a total of `4*4*4*4=256` possible board configurations.</p>
      <div class="ln-box">
        <p>In general, there are</p>
        <div class="ln-center">
          <p>`n^n`</p>
        </div>
        <p>possible board configurations.</p>
      </div>
      <p>So we went from `43,680` to `256`, which is pretty good. For the `n=8` case, there are `16,777,216` possible board configurations, which is much less than `1.78 xx 10^(14)`, but still a lot.</p>
      <h3>Constrained Optimization Approach: Row and Column Constraint</h3>
      <p>We can apply the same row-constraint reasoning to the columns as well: if there is more than `1` queen on the same column, then they're automatically attacking each other.</p>
      <div class="ln-center">
        <img class="img-fluid ln-image-smaller" src="../pictures/ai2/4_queens_4.png">
      </div>
      <p>So any board configurations where there is more than `1` queen in the same row and column can be removed from the search space. We can achieve this by introducing another constraint: "Given `n` queens, find a configuration for the queens on an `n xx n` chessboard such that <strong>every row and column contains exactly one queen</strong> while maximizing the number of pairs of non-attacking queens."</p>
      <div class="ln-box">
        <p>Mathematically, for all `1 le i,j le n`, `Q_i != Q_j` and `i != j`.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Let's see how much the search space has been reduced by with this new constraint. Again, we'll first consider the `n=4` case.</p>
      <p>The first queen can only be placed in the first row, and in the first row, there are only `4` spaces for it. The second queen can only be placed in the second row, and in the second row, there are only `3` spaces for it. The third queen can only be placed in the third row, and in the third row, there are only `2` spaces for it. The last queen can only be placed in the fourth row, and in the fourth row, there is only `1` space for it. So there are a total of `4*3*2*1=24` possible board configurations.</p>
      <div class="ln-box">
        <p>In general, there are</p>
        <div class="ln-center">
          <p>`n!`</p>
        </div>
        <p>possible board configurations.</p>
      </div>
      <p>For the `n=8` case, there are now only `4032` board configurations in the search space.</p>
      <div class="ln-box">
        <p>Introducing constraints on the problem made the `n`-queens problem much easier to solve. However, even with the constraints, it is still a hard problem to solve, especially when `n` gets larger. Here's a table with the size of the search space for each version of the problem.</p>
        <div class="ln-center">

        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="ln-box">
        <p>So why are we even looking at the `n`-queens problem in the first place? It looks like a trivial puzzle.</p>
        <p>Well, it turns out that the `n`-queens problem has practical applications in things like task scheduling and computer resource management.</p>
      </div>
      <h2 id="evolutionarycomputing">Evolutionary Computing</h2>
      <p>Going through each possible board configuration to find a valid one is not practical. It would be better to programmatically generate solutions.</p>
      <p>One way of doing this is through evolutionary computing. Evolutionary computing is a research area within computer science that draws inspiration from evolution and natural selection.</p>
      <div class="ln-box">
        <p>Nature is apparently a good source of inspiration. The best problem solver known in nature is the human brain (basis of neurocomputing) and the evolutionary mechanism that created the human brain (basis of evolutionary computing).</p>
      </div>
      <p>The metaphor here is that the problem is like the environment; a candidate solution is like an individual; and the quality of the candidate solution is like the individual's "fitness" level.</p>
      <p>The population consists of candidate solutions and the best ones are selected for "reproduction". This produces new solutions (containing the traits from both of the parents), and those new solutions are modified slightly to maintain diversity. And this process repeats.</p>
      <div class="ln-center">
        <img class="img-fluid" src="../pictures/ai2/evolutionary_algorithm.png">
        <p>(image borrowed from my professor)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="ln-box">
        <p>The population is initialized by selecting a random subset of the search space.</p>
      </div>
      <p>There are two inherent, competing forces in evolutionary algorithms. The process of recombination (reproduction) and mutation promotes diversity and represents a push towards novelty. The process of selecting the fittest parents or survivors decreases diversity and represents a push towards quality. By going back and forth between these two forces, evolutionary algorithms balance exploration and exploitation to find optimal results.</p>
      <h3>Evolutionary Algorithm Components: Representation</h3>
      <p>Recall that earlier we were representing board configurations using coordinates and vectors (permutation encoding). In biological terms, what we were doing was mapping phenotypes (real-world solutions) to genotypes (encoded solutions).</p>
      <div class="ln-box">
        <p>A phenotype is the set of observable characteristics of an organism. A genotype is the complete set of genetic material of an organism.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Evolutionary Algorithm Components: Evaluation (Fitness) Function</h3>
      <p>Once we have encoded representations of the inputs, we can programmatically assess their quality. This is where the objective function we saw earlier comes in. </p>
      <div class="ln-box">
        <p>In the phenotype space, the function is called an objective function. In the genotype space, the function is called a fitness function.</p>
      </div>
      <p>The fitness function assigns a numerical value (referred to as fitness value) to each phenotype so that the algorithm can know which ones to select for recombination. Typically, the "fittest" individuals have high fitness values, so we seek to maximize fitness.</p>

        <p>Formally, a population is a multiset of candidate solutions. This means that repeated elements are allowed to exist in the population.</p>
        <p>A population is considered to be the basic unit of evolution. So a population evolves, not single individuals.</p>
        <p>Diversity of a population can refer to either fitness diversity or phenotype/genotype diversity.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Evolutionary Algorithm Components: Selection Mechanism</h3>
      <p>The selection mechanism compares the fitness values of the solutions to decide which ones become parents.</p>
      <p>Even though the general goal is to push the population towards higher fitness, the selection mechanism is usually probabilistic. Higher-quality solutions are more likely to be selected, but sub-optimal (or even the worst) solutions can still be picked.</p>
      <div class="ln-box">
        <p>Even though it might seem like it makes the most sense to just pick the solutions with the highest fitness values, it's sometimes necessary to not do that. Evolutionary algorithms can get stuck in a local maximum, and the only way to get out would be to pick sub-optimal solutions. Biologically, this is referred to as "genetic drift".</p>
      </div>
      <p>An example of a selection mechanism is a roulette wheel. Suppose we have three solutions `A, B, C`. `A` has a fitness of `3`; `B` has a fitness of `1`; `C` has a fitness of `2`. We can put them on a roulette wheel like so:</p>
      <p>This way, `A`, which has the highest fitness value, has the highest chance of being selected.</p>
      <p>The selection mechanism is also responsible for replacing the elements in the population with survivors.</p>
      <p>While parent selection is usually probabilistic, survivor selection is usually deterministic. The process can be fitness based (compare the fitness values of the parents + offspring) or age based (replace as many parents as possible with offspring).</p>
      <h3>Evolutionary Algorithm Components: Recombination</h3>
      <p>Once the parents are selected, the offspring need to be produced. Recombination is the process of merging information from the parents into the offspring. The choice of what information to merge is random, so it's possible that the offspring can be worse or the same as the parents.</p>
      <h3>Evolutionary Algorithm Components: Termination</h3>
      <p>The algorithm has to stop eventually. There are several conditions we can use to determine when to stop:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>reaching some desired level of fitness</li>
        <li>reaching the maximum allowed number of generations</li>
        <li>reaching some level of diversity</li>
        <li>reaching some number of generations without fitness improvement</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>`8`-Queens Problem</h3>
      <p>Now we'll look at each evolutionary algorithm component for the `8`-queens problem.</p>
      <h4>Representation</h4>
      <p>The phenotype is a board configuration and the genotype is a vector containing a permutation of the numbers from `1` through `8`.</p>
      <div class="ln-center">
        <img class="img-fluid ln-image-smaller" src="../pictures/ai2/8_queens.png">
        <p>`Q = [1, 4, 2, 6, 3, 5, 7, 8]^T`</p>
      </div>
      <h4>Fitness Evaluation</h4>
      <p>The fitness function is</p>
      <div class="ln-center">
        <p>`f(Q) = (n(n-1))/2-A(Q)`</p>
      </div>
      <p>For the example board configuration above:</p>
      <div class="ln-center">
        <p>`f(Q) = (8(7))/2-4 = 24`</p>
      </div>
      <h4>Selection</h4>
      <p>We'll pick `5` parents at random and select the best `2` to undergo crossover. Let's arbitrarily say the best `2` are</p>

      <h4>Recombination</h4>
      <p>We'll combine the parents' information into the new offspring by picking a random crossover point and splitting/combining at that point.</p>

        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Using the pink line as the crossover point, we get these 2 new offspring:</p>

      <p>Importantly, when doing the combining, any repeated values need to be taken care of since we're constrained to exactly `1` queen per row and column.</p>
      <h4>Mutation</h4>
      <p>For each of the offspring, we'll choose two random positions and swap them. Here's an example with one of the offspring:</p>
