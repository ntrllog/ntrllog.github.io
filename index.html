          <p>i graduated from the university of california, san diego with a b.s. in math-computer science and a minor in math education.</p>
        </div>
        <p>i've worked with many students from kindergarten to college, helping them learn math and computer science. i started out as a volunteer math tutor at high schools, where i tutored individual students in calculus and integrated math 1, 2, and 3. i also interned at a computer science education company called <a href="https://www.thoughtstem.com/" target="_blank">thoughtstem</a>, where i helped elementary, middle, and high school students with making programs in <a href="https://racket-lang.org/" target="_blank">racket</a>. eventually, i became an instructor for thoughtstem where i led after school programs for kindergarten students to fifth graders to teach them how to make games in racket. i've also been a programming instructor aide for uc san diego extension where i helped high school students debug their ios and android apps and a computer science tutor for uc san diego where i helped college students learn and understand introductory programming concepts.</p>
        <p>i'm a developer. i like to program <a href="https://aln.netlify.app/projects">applications</a> to learn new concepts and practice my programming skills.</p>
        <p>i'm a self-taught android app maker. i like to make small <a href="https://aln.netlify.app/projects#apps">apps</a> to make my life a <em>little</em> bit easier. a few of those apps are published on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=ntrllog" target="_blank">google play store</a>.</p>
        <p>i'm a self-taught website maker. i like to make <a href="https://aln.netlify.app/projects#ed_res">educational resources</a> for math and computer science. admittedly, they're mostly for my personal use, but they're there.</p>
        <p>on the more creative side of things, i like to draw <a href="https://aln.netlify.app/comics">comics</a> and write <a href="writings.html">blog posts</a>. they usually revolve around math, computer science, and english.</p>
