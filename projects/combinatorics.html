              <p>Let `P(n)` be the statement that there are `2^n` subsets of a set of size `n`</p>
              <p>For a set with `0` elements, the only subset is `O/`, which is consistent with `2^0 = 1` so `P(0)` is true</p>
              <p>Suppose `P(n)` is true. Want to show `P(n+1)` is true, i.e. there are `2^(n+1)` subsets of a set of size `n+1`</p>
              <p>Let `S` be a set of size `n+1`</p>
              <p>Fix any `x in S` and consider `S' = S\\{x}`</p>
              <p>Since `S'` has `n` elements, there are `2^n` subsets</p>
              <p>Every subset of `S` either contains `x` or it doesn't contain `x`</p>
              <p>The subsets that don't contain `x` are in `S'`, which has `2^n` subsets</p>
              <p>So there are `2^n` subsets that don't contain `x`</p>
              <p>The subsets that do contain `x` can be obtained by adding `x` to each subset that doesn't contain `x`</p>
              <p>So there are `2^n` subsets that do contain `x`</p>
              <p>The total number of subsets of `S` is the number of subsets containing `x` plus the number of the subsets not containing `x`</p>

          <p>Let's suppose you're arranging flowers. You have `2` red flowers and `1` yellow flower. How many ways can we arrange them? Previously, we saw that if we have `n` elements, there are `n!` ways to arrange them. Here, we have `3` elements, so there are `3! = 6` ways to arrange them. All the possible orderings are:</p>
          <div class="math">
            <p>`R RY`</p>
            <p>`R RY`</p>

          <p>But some of the orderings are repeated. This is because the `2` red flowers are technically different flowers, but the order in which they appear doesn't matter; the result is the same. So we have to divide out the commonalities. In this case, since there are `2` red flowers and, therefore, `2!` ways to order them, we divide the total number of ways to arrange all the elements by `2!`.</p>

            <p>Theorem: For `n ge 0`, `(x+y)^n = sum_(i=0)^n ((n),(i)) x^iy^(n-i)`</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="binomialproof">
              <p>Consider the expansion `(x+y)^n = ubrace((x+y)(x+y)...(x+y))_n`</p>

              <p>`vdots`</p>
              <p>And repeat until all possible terms have been multiplied (`2^n` times)</p>
              <p>Some terms will be repeated. For example, FFF...L (`x*x*x*...*y`) and FFLF...F (`x*x*y*x*...*x`) both have `n-1` `x's` and `1` `y`</p>
              <p>The number of repeated terms is the number of ways to create a term that has that form</p>
              <p>The form of each term will be `i` `x's` and `n-i` `y's`</p>
              <p>Which gives us `((n),(i))` ways to create `x^iy^(n-i)`</p>
              <p>To get the final answer, we sum up all the products</p>

            <p>There's an interesting result when we expand the sum:</p>
            <div class="math">

            <p>This means the number of subsets with even size equals the number of subsets with odd size</p>
            <p>So there are `(2^n)/2 = 2^(n-1)` subsets with even size (and likewise for subsets with odd size)</p>

            <div class="math">
              <p>`1/(1+x) = sum_(n ge 0) (-1)^nx^n`</p>
            </div>
            <p>Using the binomial theorem, we should get the same result</p>
            <p>From the binomial theorem: `(1+x)^(-1) = sum_(n ge 0) ((-1),(n))x^n`</p>
            <div class="math">

            <p>So `(1+x)^(-d) = 1/(1+x)^d = sum_(n ge 0) (-1)^n((d+n-1),(n))x^n`</p>
            <p>If we substitute `-x` for `x`, we get `(1-x)^(-d) = 1/(1-x)^d = sum_(n ge 0) (-1)^n((d+n-1),(n))(-x)^n = sum_(n ge 0) ((d+n-1),(n))x^n`</p>

              <p>Let `f:A rarr B` be defined as follows:</p>
              <p>For a partition in `A`, add the singleton `{n+1}` and merge together all the singleton blocks into one block</p>
              <p>This produces an element in `B` because there are no singleton blocks, i.e. every block has size `gt 1`</p>
              <p>Let `g:B rarr A` be defined as follows:</p>
              <p>For a partition in `B`, break up the block containing `n+1` into singletons and remove the singleton `{n+1}`</p>
              <p>This produces an element in `A` because there are now singleton blocks, i.e. there is at least one block with size `1`</p>
              <p>So `g` is the inverse of `f`</p>
              <p>`implies f` is a bijection</p>
              <p>`implies |A| = |B|`</p>
              <p>`implies B(n)-F(n) = F(n+1)`</p>
              <p>`implies B(n) = F(n) + F(n+1)`</p>
