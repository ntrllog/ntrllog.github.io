            <p>The bombe helped us win World War II. Nope, that's not a typo. The bombe was a machine designed by Alan Turing to decipher encrypted German messages. With the bombe, the Allies knew exactly what the Germans' plans were, allowing them to move troops out of danger and invade at opportune moments. Because of this -- and other remarkable achievements -- Alan Turing is considered to be a war hero who helped win the war.</p>

            <h6 class="date">September 12, 2019</h6>
            <p>Java. C++. Python. JavaScript. If you are familiar with the world of computer science, then it is likely that you have heard the names of these languages and possibly others. If you are looking to introduce computer science to your children, then you have probably wondered, “What programming language should my student learn?” It’s a valid question. And it’s one that many people ask us all the time.</p>

            <h4 class="title">The Answer's Not in the Code</h4>
            <h6 class="date">September 8, 2019</h6>
            <p>As a programmer, I don't really think about user interfaces a lot. Heck, we navigate through our computers by typing cryptic commands into a simple black window with no buttons. Our only goal is to get the program working. Making it look nice is some graphic designer's job. Even though programmers can get by without knowing a single thing about graphic design, it's still worthwhile to know a thing or two about user interfaces.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseNotInTheCode">
              <p>I recently redesigned one of my past Android apps that played audio.</p>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="pictures/writings/design/rapplayer.png">
              <p>It used a ListView as the root layout and utilized a custom ArrayAdapter to populate the list. (I know, I know. RecyclerViews are much better. I didn't know at the time.) It doesn't look like an audio player, but I actually put an OnClickListener on each list item itself.</p>
              <p>I wanted to redesign the app,  not because the UI was bad, but because I wanted a button that would show the lyrics to a particular song. And I wanted play/stop functionality within the app. Again, I'm not a graphic designer, so my thought was just to keep the same ListView implementation, but just add 2 buttons to each list item. Not too hard right?</p>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="pictures/writings/design/buttons.jpg"> 
              <p>Yeah it wasn't too hard at all. But the bugs that came with it were headache inducing. If I pushed the play button, the button would change to the stop icon, which was fine. But when I scrolled up and down, random buttons would change icons randomly. Buttons that had a play icon before going off the screen would have a stop icon when coming back onto the screen. And buttons that had a stop icon before would have a play icon when coming back.</p>
              <p>This was because I was setting each button's icon in the ArrayAdapter's getView() method, which seemed like the only logical place to do so. The problem is that the View and position that are passed into the getView() method are relative to what's on the screen. Meaning that if the song that is currently playing is at position=1, then when I scroll up or down, it won't be at position=1 anymore. However, my code is programmed to have the stop button on the View at position=1, because the song that is currently playing used to be at position=1. So when I scroll up or down, whichever song ends up being at position=1 will have the stop button instead.</p>
              <p>I could've kept track of each button's state in some custom class or database or whatever and used that to update the buttons. But I thought about what the students were doing in an iOS App Production class. They were creating different user interfaces for a rock-paper-scissors game. So that inspired me to try a different user interface instead.</p>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="pictures/writings/design/lyrical.jpg"> 
              <p>The result was nice on several levels. Not only did I completely avoid that bug, but I also had a slightly better user interface. Namely, bigger buttons. And only 2 buttons, so no tapping the wrong play button.</p>
              <p>When there's a bug, sometimes the answer isn't just adding more code to patch up the holes. Sometimes, the answer lies in the design.</p>

            <h4 class="title">Why Software Developers Need to Learn Empathy (as well as Coding)</h4>
            <h6 class="date">August 26, 2019</h6>
            <p>Empathy: Caring for other people and sharing in their feelings and experiences. It’s undoubtedly an important quality for everyone to have. Empathy is also something that is taught through families, through teachers, through friends. If education is to prepare people for success in the world, then empathy has to be a big part of their education. It’s easy to see how useful having empathy would be for areas such as business, marketing, or any other type of work that requires interacting with other people. However, empathy is just as important for people in computer science.</p>

            <p>I had the chance to work personally with some students who were taking introductory programming courses. The first student took a MATLAB course in person. The second person took a Java course online. Here, I want to record some of their insights before I forget them or something.</p>
            <p><b>Is programming something you want to continue learning or doing?</b></p>
            <div class="collapse" id="learningCSBeginnerQ1">
              <p><em>1) Programming is interesting, but probably wouldn't pursue it as a career. Maybe for fun</em></p>
              <p><em>2) Yes, there are several applications of programming in psychology</em></p>
              <p>Here, I was just interested to see if they were "turned off" by programming after struggling through it.</p>

            <div class="collapse" id="learningCSBeginnerQ2">
              <p><em>1) Java</em></p>
              <p><em>2) learn more languages</em></p>

            <a class="btn toggle-text" data-toggle="collapse" href="#learningCSBeginnerQ2"><span>Read more</span><span class="hidden">Read less</span></a>
            <p><b>Before taking the class, did you expect it to be easy or hard? Why?</b></p>
            <div class="collapse" id="learningCSBeginnerQ3">
              <p><em>1) Hard: Other people make computer science seem hard</em></p>
              <p><em>2) Hard: Other people say coding is hard, thought of self as not tech-savvy</em></p>
              <p>I just wanna say that while computer science is hard, any other subject could be just as difficult. I find it interesting that people are quick to say that computer science is hard, but I hardly hear people saying the same thing about biology, art, history, reading, writing, etc.</p>
            </div>
            <a class="btn toggle-text" data-toggle="collapse" href="#learningCSBeginnerQ3"><span>Read more</span><span class="hidden">Read less</span></a>
            <p><b>There's this conception that people are naturally good at some subjects. For example, there are "math people". Do you agree with this idea after taking the class?</b></p>
            <div class="collapse" id="learningCSBeginnerQ4">
              <p><em>1) Yes, some people are naturally good at computer science</em></p>
              <p><em>2) No, anyone can learn. Yes to a certain extent because some people are naturally good, but people can work towards it. Coding is not purely math, it involves both math and some creativity, so it activates both hemispheres of the brain</em></p>
              <p>I do believe that some people are naturally good at some subjects. However, I also believe that anyone can learn anything if they want to. Just because someone isn't a "math person" doesn't mean they'll never understand math. Different subjects require different mindsets (i.e. ways of thinking) so recognizing this is a good first step.</p>

            <p><b>Was there a point when things started to suddenly make sense?</b></p>
            <div class="collapse" id="learningCSBeginnerQ5">
              <p><em>1) Yes, after learning in class and doing examples in MATLAB. Learned more in labs because putting concepts into practice</em></p>
              <p><em>2) Yes, after learning loops</em></p>
              <p>Regarding computer science, I believe that there is a point where nothing makes sense at first, but everything "clicks" at a later time. I've personally experienced it for computer science and linear algebra. I struggled for the first 8 weeks of my first programming class, but around week 8, everything from day 1 just somehow suddenly made total sense to me. I didn't understand a thing about linear algebra (I got a C- or something in that class out of sheer luck) but after taking an upper div math course related to linear algebra 4 years later, most things in linear algebra suddenly makes total sense to me.</p>
              <p>These students seemed to have a slightly different experience than I did though. Especially with the first student, it seemed to be more of a repeated process of not understanding, then understanding each topic.</p>

            <p><b>What did you do that helped you understand the concepts?</b></p>
            <div class="collapse" id="learningCSBeginnerQ6">

              <p><em>2) Make up small programs and watch YouTube videos. Can look at lecture notes all you want, but won't learn until you do it (or even just watch other people do it).</em></p>
              <p>It probably goes without saying (but I'm gonna say it anyway!) that practice is invaluable.

              <p>Regarding the lecture notes, these answers aren't contradictory because they were in different situations. The lecture notes for the first student were really helpful, with some explanations and lot of practice questions. The lecture notes for the second student were not that great. There was a lot of text, few (correct) specific examples, and a lot of general, abstract examples.</p>

            <h4 class="title">The Clock Problem</h4>
            <h6 class="date">July 23, 2019</h6>
            <p>Have you ever wondered when the hands of a clock overlap so that they're exactly on top of each other? Me too! (Wait, did you say no? I mean, me neither!)</p>
            <p>It's very tempting to say that the hands overlap at 1:05, 2:10, 3:15, ... and so on. But if you think about it, the hands aren't going to overlap exactly at, say, 10:50 because the hour hand would be closer to the 11 at this time. So does this mean they actually don't overlap exactly at 1:05, 2:10, 3:15, ... ?</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseClockProblem">
              <p>Let's set up the problem more formally. Assuming the hands move smoothly and continuously, if we begin at 12:00, when's the next time the hour and minute hands will overlap?</p>
              <p>It will be easier to think about this problem in terms of distances. The hands will overlap if they have traveled the same distance from the 12:00 point. Because the distances they have travelled vary depending on how many minutes have passed, we can represent their distances as functions of time, e.g. d_h(t) and d_m(t) where t is the number of minutes after 12:00.</p>
              <p>So this means we're looking for a t such that d_h(t) = d_m(t). In words, we're looking for the number of minutes that will go by until the hour hand and minute hand have travelled the same distance.</p>
              <p>The minute hand makes one full revolution around the clock in 60 minutes. Which means after t minutes, the minute hand will travel a distance of t/60. <strong>So d_m(t) = t/60 is the function that represents the distance the minute hand has travelled after t minutes.</strong></p>
              <p>The hour hand makes one full revolution around the clock in 720 minutes (It takes 60 minutes to reach an hour; since there are 12 hours, it will take 60*12 = 720 minutes.) So d_h(t) = t/720 is the function that represents the distance the hour hand has travelled after t minutes. Well, almost.</p>
              <p>The hour hand and minute hand won't overlap between 12:00 and 1:00. This means, when it's 1:00, the hour hand will have travelled 1/12 of the way when the minute hand is back at the 12:00 mark again. <strong>So d_h(t) = t/720 + 1/12 is the function that represents the distance the hour hand has travelled after t minutes.</strong></p>
              <p>Now that we have equations for d_h(t) and d_m(t), we can set them equal to each other to solve for t.</p>
              <p>d_h(t) = d_m(t)</p>
              <p>t/720 + 1/12 = t/60</p>
              <p>11t/720 = 1/12</p>
              <p>11t = 60</p>
              <p>t = 60/11</p>
              <p>So after 60/11 minutes, or about 5 minutes and 27 seconds, the hands will overlap at 1:05:27.</p>
              <p>To generalize this for the n<sup>th</sup> time the hands overlap, we can redefine d_h(t) to account for the distance the hour hand has travelled when the minute hand reaches the 12:00 mark. <strong>Then it would be d_h(t,n) = t/720 + n/12, where n is the number of hours after 12:00.</strong></p>
              <p>For n = 2, the hands will overlap at 2:10:55.</p>
              <p>For n = 10, the hands will overlap at 10:54:33.</p>
              <p>For n = 11, the hands will overlap at 12:00</p>
              <p>This leads to another interesting result: <strong>the hands of a clock overlap only 11 times in a 12-hour period.</strong></p>

            <h4 class="title">MATLAB as a First Programming Language</h4>
            <h6 class="date">July 10, 2019</h6>
            <p>Java. C. C++. Python. Javascript. Those who taught themselves computer programming likely wondered which programming language to learn first. Those who are looking to teach themselves computer programming are likely asking the same thing.</p>
            <p>What's interesting is that among all the names of languages that get thrown out there, MATLAB isn't one of them. Well, as it's pretty much only used in the engineering fields, maybe it's not so surprising.</p>
            <p>MATLAB is pretty different from the other "conventional" languages (like the ones mentioned above). Those differences, however, kind of make MATLAB a nice first language to learn.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseMATLABFirstLanguage">
              <p><strong>In MATLAB, indices start at 1.</strong> So if we have <code>vec = [5,4,7]</code>, <code>vec(1)</code> would be equal to 5. And the third element would be <code>vec(3)</code>. Using 1-based indexing makes accessing elements in vectors/arrays/lists more intuitive. It's a bit weird to beginning programmers to access the second element by <code>vec(1)</code>, where the index doesn't match the position you're looking for.</p>
              <p><strong>In MATLAB, function headers are defined as: <code>function [output] = functionName(input)</code>.</strong> Having the variable for the return value in the header makes it a bit clearer the function is going to "return" the output value. It's easier to see this in MATLAB than it is in Java (<code>public int functionName()</code>) or even Python (<code>def functionName:</code>). I would even argue that it makes the concept of return clearer.</p>

            <h4 class="title">Closest Point</h4>

            <a href="#math_in_cs">#MathInCS</a>
            <p>So you have a set of equally-spaced points. The task is to find the 2 closest points to any random point that's given to you. For notation, let h be the space between 2 points and let z be the random point.</p>
            <p>For example, you could have a set of 5 points with a difference of h = 2 between each point: {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}. The closest points to z = 7 would be 6 and 8.</p>
            <p>For another example, you could have a set of 6 points with a difference of h = 3 between each point: {0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15}. The closest points to z = 11 would be 9 and 12.</p>
            <p>(Imagine you have a set of 100 equally-spaced points from —&pi; to &pi; and you want to find the closest points to z.)</p>
            <p>Solution:</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseClosestPoint">
              <p>To do this, we could do <code>z — z mod h</code> to get the left point, and then add h to get the right point.</p>
              <p>7 — 7 mod 2 = 7 — 1 = 6</p>
              <p>6 + 2 = 8</p>
              <p>11 — 11 mod 3 = 11 — 2 = 9</p>
              <p>9 + 3 = 12</p>
              <p>In the case of the second example, what we're doing is counting by 3's until we reach 11. 3 doesn't divide into 11 evenly, so there's going to be some remainder. This is why we subtract off the remainder from 11 to find out what the closest point was that was evenly divisible by 3.</p>

            <h6 class="date">April 14, 2019 (last updated on April 15, 2019)</h6>
            <a href="#math_in_cs">#MathInCS</a>
            <br>
            <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/fair-rations/problem" target="_blank">HackerRank link</a>
            <p>So there is a line of people who are getting bread. Some of them may or may not already have bread. When you give a loaf of bread to Person A, you also have to give a loaf either to the person directly in front of or directly behind Person A. The task is to find the lowest number of loaves you have to give out so that everyone in line has an even amount of loaves. (Or determine if it's not possible.)</p>
            <p>For example, we could have 2-5-7, which means that the first person has 2 loaves, the second person has 5 loaves, and the third person has 7 loaves. We could give out 1 loaf of bread to the second person and 1 loaf of bread to the person behind, which is the third person. Then it becomes 2-6-8. Everyone has an even number of loaves, and we had to distribute 2 loaves to get there.</p>
            <p>Solution:</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseFairRations">
              <p>The brute force solution might involve checking how many loaves each person has every time we give out loaves. But it turns out that we don't even need to know how many loaves each person has.</p>
              <p>Instead of looking at how to actually solve this problem, I want to look at knowing when it is impossible to distribute loaves such that everyone has an even amount. That is, it might be possible that no matter how many loaves we give out, there will always be at least one person with an odd number.</p>
              <p>It will be impossible for everyone to have an even number in this case: 2-3-2. But not in this case: 5-2-3-2. Why is that?</p>
              <p>Let's look at the total number of loaves that people already have in each case. 7 and 12. Since this problem deals with even and odd, let's look at those numbers that way. 7 is odd and 12 is even. So it looks like it won't work if the total number of loaves is odd, and it will work if the total number of loaves is even?</p>
              <p>Yes, that is actually true. But why?</p>
              <p>Let's start with 2-3-2 and reorganize it so that the people with an even number of loaves are on the left and the people with an odd number of loaves are on the right. 2-2-3. We're not going to give loaves to the first or second person because they already have an even number of loaves. So let's give a loaf to the third person. According to the rules, this means we also have to give one to the second person (the person directly in front). 2-3-4. Reorganizing the line again, we get 2-4-3. We end up with one person with an odd number again. And this will continue forever, because adding 1 to an even number will result in an odd number (and there will always be an even number to add 1 to because adding 1 to an odd number results in an even number).</p>
              <p>Now let's look at 5-2-3-2 and reorganize that. 2-2-3-5. Giving loaves to the third and fourth person, we end up with 2-2-4-6. Everyone has an even number of loaves, so we're done.</p>
              <p>Generalizing this, we can pair up odd numbers so that when we give each person in a pair one loaf, they turn into even numbers. If there are an even amount of odd numbers, then every odd number will have a partner and each one will turn into an even number. If there are an odd amount of odd numbers, then pairing them up will always result in one odd number left without a partner. So it will be impossible for everyone to have an even number of loaves.</p>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="pictures/writings/even_odd.jpg">
              <p>It also turns out that adding even numbers with an even amount of odd numbers results in an even number. Adding even numbers with an odd amount of odd numbers results in an odd number. This is why we can distribute loaves if the total number is even, and we can't when the total number is odd.</p>

            <h6 class="date">April 14, 2019</h6>

            <br>
            <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/manasa-and-stones/problem" target="_blank">HackerRank link</a>
            <p>So there are a number of stones on a path that are numbered starting from 0. Each consecutive stone differs by one of two values. The task is to find out all the numbers the last stone could have.</p>
            <p>For example, we could have: 0 -> 2 -> 11 -> 13. The difference between each consecutive stone is either 2 or 9. Assuming there are a total of 4 stones, all the possible numbers the last stone could have are:  13, 6, 27, 20.</p>
            <p>Solution:</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseManasaAndStones">
              <p>The brute force solution is to generate all the possible paths and then find the last number in each path.</p>
              <p>How could we do better? Well, we know that one possible path is where the differences between each stone are all 2's. So the last stone would be 6.</p>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="pictures/writings/manasas/first_path.png">
              <p>Another possible path is where the differences are all 9's. So the last stone would be a 27.</p>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="pictures/writings/manasas/last_path.jpg">
              <p>So now the only options left are situations where [two differences are 2's and one difference is 9] and [two differences are 9's and one difference is 2]. (However, this doesn't mean that there are two paths left. There are actually 6 paths left because we don't know which stones have the difference of 2 and which stones have the difference of 9. For example, the differences could go [2 -> 2 -> 9] or [2 -> 9 -> 2] or [9 -> 2 -> 2].)</p>
              <p>So how do we generalize this? First, notice that there are 3 differences between 4 stones. Generally, there are n-1 differences between n stones. Second, recall how we generated the first two paths: considering the situation where all the differences were the same. This is the same as multiplying the first difference n-1 times and multiplying the second difference n-1 times. This makes sense because if there are n-1 differences and each difference is the same number, then the last number is the result of multiplying the difference by the number of differences (n-1).</p>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="pictures/writings/manasas/multiplying.jpg">
              <p>Third, note that paths with differences like [2 -> 2-> 9], [2 -> 9 -> 2], and [9 -> 2 -> 2] all result in the last stone having the same number.</p>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="pictures/writings/manasas/same_difference.jpg">
              <p>This is because we're essentially adding all the possible combinations of 2's and 9's to get the last stone. Addition is commutative, meaning we can switch the order of the numbers and still get the same result. Recognizing this is crucial because this means we don't have to waste time generating paths that will give us the same result anyway.</p>
              <p>Combining these three points give us the following approach to solving the problem:</p>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="pictures/writings/manasas/algorithm.png">
              <p>In words, we're considering all the possible combination of 2's and 9's for 3 differences (4 stones means there are 3 differences.)</p>
              <p><strong>In general, this algorithm considers all possible combinations of differences. Combinations because order doesn't matter.</strong></p>
              <p>Note: There are 2<sup>n-1</sup> total possible paths (n-1 differences, 2 choices for each difference). If n is really big (i.e. there are a lot of stones) then the brute force approach would take a really long time. Also recall that some of those paths resulted in the same answer for the last stone, so it's also inefficient.</p>
              <p>Second note: It's also no coincidence that there is a pattern in the last number of the last stone. Notice how each last number differs by 7 (e.g. 6 + 7 = 13, 13 + 7 = 20), which also happens to be the difference between the differences 2 and 9 (i.e. 9 — 2 = 7). This is because, as we're going down the table, we taking away a 2 and adding a 9 (i.e. doing 9 — 2), resulting in adding a 7.</p>
              <p>Third note: I believe the number of stones always equals the number of unique last numbers, simply because there are n numbers between 0 and n-1. (We're trying to find the last stone when there are 0 differences of 9, 1 difference of 9, 2 differences of 9, ..., n-1 differences of 9.)</p>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="pictures/writings/manasas/formula.jpg">
              <p>I'll be convinced if this equation is true. Unless my equation is wrong.</p>

            <p>So there are some cities and some space stations on a route. For simplicity, they can be thought of as being lined up in a straight line, so that when you walk on that line, you will walk through a city or a space station. And every city and space station are 1 km apart from each other. The task is to find the longest distance between a city to the <em>nearest</em> space station.</p>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="pictures/writings/flatland_space_station/problem.jpg">
            <p>Solution:</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseFlatlandSpaceStations">
              <p>The brute force solution is to find the distance between every city and the nearest space station to it.</p>
              <p>How could we do better? We could get a better solution by observing the position of a city that would be at the farthest distance from the nearest space station. Let's suppose we're placing a city between two space stations such that it results in the longest distance possible to the nearest space station. We can't place it near the space stations because the farthest distance to the nearest space station would be really small. So we should put it somewhere in the middle of the two space stations.</p>
              <p>Let's consider placing it directly in the middle of the two space stations then. This means that the distance to one space station is exactly the same as the distance to the other space station. Moving it a little bit to the left or right makes it closer to a space station (and thus it's no longer at the farthest distance possible).</p>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="pictures/writings/flatland_space_station/city_shift.jpg">
              <p>This suggests that <strong>the farthest distance a city can be from any two space stations is half of the distance between the two space stations.</strong> So instead of looking at the distance from every city, we look at the distance from every two space stations and calculate the distance to their midpoint. The largest distance from doing that should be the farthest distance from any city to the nearest space station. (Notice that this supports the situation in the first picture. Also notice that this works even if there an even number of cities between two space stations.)</p>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="pictures/writings/flatland_space_station/solution.jpg">
              <p>There are edge cases, but this is the main idea.</p>

            <h6 class="date">April 13, 2019</h6>
            <p>For some reason, there's this perceived notion that computer science and math are closely related. Some believe that you need to be good at math to do well in computer science. Or that doing well in computer science means that you're good at math. This isn't true. Ask a first-year computer science student how much math they use and how complicated the math is. Or learn programming and see for yourself. :)</p>
            <p>I would like to present a different argument though: approaching computer science from a math perspective makes you a better problem solver. (So being good at math makes you better at solving some computer science problems.) And I don't mean simply finding a solution to a problem. I mean finding an optimal solution — or, at the very least, a better one than brute force — to a problem.</p>
            <p>Here are some problems from HackerRank where I used math (or mathematical thinking/reasoning) to come up with a better solution than one that uses brute force.</p>
            <ul>

            </ul>
            <p>These problems aren't necessarily difficult, but I think they present great opportunities to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>use math rigorously to justify and explain why certain methods work</p></li>
              <li><p>explore math (that you've learned) and apply it in ways not used in the classroom</p></li>

            <h4 class="title">Mnemonic Devices</h4>
            <h6 class="date">April 10, 2019 (last updated on April 15, 2019)</h6>
            <p>IHMDIM. I hate mnemonic devices in math. Well, actually, hate is a bit strong. I guess "dislike" is a more appropriate word.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseMnemonicDevices">
              <p>(Here, I define a mnemonic as a series of steps, a shortcut, or a memorization technique.)</p>
              <p>I don't dislike all math mnemonics. The only ones (I can think of at the moment) that I'm okay with are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>PEMDAS</li>
                <li>SOAP</li>
                <li>FOIL</li>
                <li>the quadratic formula</li>
                <li>SOHCAHTOA</li>
              </ul>
              <p>My dislike for mnemonics is guided by my idea of what it means to truly understand math (or at least whatever you're learning): understanding the intuition/reason behind why things are done.</p>
              <p><strong>Mnemonics are hard to remember (at the moment and/or in the future).</strong></p>
              <p>Some of us were taught how to factor quadratic polynomials using an "x". Well, what numbers go where in the "x"? It's hard to remember because there is no intuitive reason behind where the numbers go. Also, nothing about an "x" suggests what should be done with the numbers. It's just a specific series of steps that we were taught to memorize. And because they're so specific, we forget them once we stop working with them.</p>
              <p>It's much easier to know how to factor polynomials if we understand that the resulting product has to multiply to the original polynomial. From there, we can come up with a method for factoring.</p>
              <p><strong>Mnemonics abstract away what is going on underneath.</strong></p>
              <p>Some of us were taught that we could find the roots of a polynomial by "switching the signs." You know, if there's an (x—3), then a root is going to be (3,0) because we changed the negative to a positive. Of course, this isn't the only way that's taught, but it is a shortcut that is introduced, which we come to rely on because, well, it's a shortcut. Since this shortcut doesn't always work (for something like (2x—3) for example), we forget how to find roots for more complicated situations.</p>
              <p>This hides the fact that roots are solutions to the equation f(x) = 0 where f(x) is a polynomial. Roots are inputs that result in an output of 0. Which is why they're sometimes also called "zeros." Understanding this makes it easier to remember that we should set each quantity of a factored polynomial equal to 0.</p>
              <p>Some of us were taught about solving for x when there were fractions involved by doing cross multiplication. Now, cross multiplication is fairly easy to remember (because it's in the name), but it is hiding the fact that what we're really doing is multiplying both sides by each denominator, canceling them out.</p>
              <p>Mnemonics lead to situations where we explain how to solve problems by saying "because that's how we do (insert mnemonic device here)." But we don't solve problems by doing what we've memorized. We solve problems by looking at what we have and using what we know to get to a solution. And part of that is understanding what the problem really is.</p>
              <p>So why do I not dislike the mnemonics I mentioned earlier?</p>
              <ul>
                <li><p>PEMDAS is a defined set of rules. Since they're <em>defined</em>, they're not abstracting away anything. And the order of the letters is intuitive: they (mostly) represent the order of the operations that we should perform.</p></li>
                <li><p>With SOAP, it just saves a lot of time finding the factored form of a difference of cubes. Trying to derive that form — although it would be interesting to do so — is time-consuming to do every time.</p></li>
                <li><p>FOIL is barely hanging on to this list. I believe that FOIL is abstracting away the actual process of multiplying quantities (treating a group of terms as one quantity and distributing that to each term). But thinking abstractly like this is on another level that <em>high school students usually don't need</em>. So FOIL just makes things easier.</p></li>
                <li><p>Like with SOAP, the quadratic formula saves time trying to derive x each time. Again, it's interesting to do so, but it's too time-consuming to do every time.</p></li>
                <li><p>SOHCAHTOA is a set of definitions. Not abstracting anything here either.</p></li>
              </ul>
              <p>As much as I dislike mnemonics, a recent interaction with a teacher has changed my perspective on this. It seems that mnemonics are easier for students to understand. Wait, let me rephrase that so it's more enlightening: intuitive reasoning is generally harder for students to understand (in the time frame with which teachers have to work). My guess is that students have grown up thinking that math is about solving a bunch of problems by performing a specific sequence of steps that the teacher wants them to do. Whatever the case may be, I'll definitely have to rethink my approach to helping students.</p>
              <p>Do you remember what letters I used in the beginning of this post and how many there were? (If you do, then forget them so I can prove a point.) Will you remember them years from now? (There's no reason to, but humor me.) Would it be easier to remember them by memorizing the letters themselves, or by understanding the meaning of my message?</p>
              <p>P.S. I guess IAMDIM would've been much easier to remember, but who uses "abhor" anyway?</p>

            <h4 class="title">Recursion as Settings</h4>
            <h6 class="date">March 10, 2019</h6>
            <p>With all the stack frames to keep track of, recursion gets a little bit tricky. One confusion with recursion is where the program continues executing after a recursive call. Does it go back to the place where the previous recursive call was made? Does it go back to the first place where the recursive call was made? Does it go back to main?</p>
            <p>Figuring out where the program continues executing after a recursive call can be compared to navigating the "Settings" section of your phone.</p>
            <p>On Android, you can do "Settings" -> "About phone" -> "Status".</p>
            <p>On iOS, you can do "Settings" -> "General" -> "About".</p>
            <p>When you're on "Status" or "About" and you press back, you would expect to go to the previous page from which you came (either "About phone" or "General"). You wouldn't press back and go to the very first page ("Settings").</p>
            <p>The same applies to recursion. You go back to the recursive call from which you came (which is going to be the most recent call).</p>

            <h4 class="title">Students as Processors</h4>
            <h6 class="date">March 5, 2019</h6>
            <p>Computer processors are like students. Processes (e.g. interacting in web browsers, playing Spotify) are to processors what classes are to students. Computer processors don't run every single application that's open on your computer all at the same time, just like students aren't focused on all their classes at the same time (For example, students aren't <em>simultaneously</em> finishing their math homework while writing an essay.) A computer processor constantly switches back and forth between each application, giving each application a little chunk of time. A student switches their focus from one class to another, giving each class a little chunk of time. The only difference is that processors switch between processes so quickly, they give the <em>illusion</em> that all the processes are running simultaneously.</p>
            <p>Let's ignore the whole multiple-core idea just to make this analogy work. Even then, it can be true if there are enough processes running.</p>

            <h6 class="date">March 3, 2019</h6>
            <p>I keep thinking about her every day. Every waking moment of my life. Even when I don't see her, she's there. Even when she's not there, her presence is looming over me. I can't do anything without her somehow crossing my mind. I can't go anywhere without thinking that I'll run into her.</p>
            <p>I keep looking for signs that aren't there. Signs that seem to confirm my fears when I'm feeling low. Signs that give me hope when I'm feeling like myself. Signs that make me come to the realization about who I really am. Signs that make me come to the realization that others see me in a way I don't see myself.</p>
            <p>I don't know how other people do it. So seemingly easily and effortlessly. Countless times, I've thought about confronting her. Countless times, I've given up at the last minute. There are so many things that could go wrong. There are so many what if's waiting to be answered.</p>
            <p>I've never really dealt with something like this before. I've experienced it in the past, but it has never made me feel what I'm feeling right now. Somehow I was always able to ignore it. Or run away from it. Perhaps those weren't the best choices to make.</p>
            <p>But this time will be different. I can't keep going on believing that things will work out the way I want them to. I have to change. I promise that I will go up to her. I promise that I won't back out at the last minute. I promise that I'll take the chance with her. If things don't work out, then at least I could say I tried.</p>

            <h4 class="title">Coding on a Chromebook</h4>
            <h6 class="date">February 19, 2019</h6>
            <p>Here's the TLDR: Coding on a Chromebook (using crouton) is possible and sometimes convenient, but not really practical or efficient given its limitations — namely, its slow processor.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseCodingOnAChromebook">
              <p>Note: To put this in perspective, I've had my Chromebook for about 7 months now.</p>
              <p>I hated carrying around my heavy 15-inch laptop everywhere, so I bought a cheap, lightweight Chromebook as a secondary machine. Because I was heavily maintaining this website at the time, I was looking to use my Chromebook more for web development than for hard-core programming (e.g. compiling Java programs).</p>
              <p>Based on several online resources, the most popular option for coding seemed to be installing crouton. (Well, using online cloud platforms was pretty popular too, but I wanted to do all coding offline. Also, wiping ChromeOS and replacing it with Linux was an option, but I wanted to keep ChromeOS.) Basically, crouton is like a program that allows you to run Linux alongside ChromeOS. It's like being able to run Windows and MacOS on one machine <em>at the same time</em>. This was the best solution for me since it kept the speed and stability of ChromeOS with the coding-friendliness of Linux. The biggest problem with crouton is that you have to put the Chromebook in developer mode, which compromises security. I didn't care.</p>
              <p>crouton is pretty easy to install, but this is an opinion coming from someone who has (very) basic scripting knowledge and familiarity with the Linux environment. I imagine it's a bit overwhelming and scary for those who don't.</p>
              <p>I tried Ubuntu with Unity and Ubuntu with Xfce and went with Xfce (Unity wouldn't run on my Chromebook.) <strong>I never encountered any problems switching from ChromeOS to Linux, but it wasn't as seamless as I thought it would be. You have to press like 4 buttons at the same time and wait a few seconds for it to switch.</strong></p>
              <p>After doing the classic <code>sudo apt-get update</code> and <code>sudo apt-get upgrade</code>, I installed Visual Studio Code, which was really the only thing I needed that I couldn't get on ChromeOS. What I like — and sometimes dislike — about Visual Studio Code is that it auto-closes HTML tags, something I didn't get out-of-the-box with Vim, Atom, Sublime, or Notepad++. (We could get into this whole thing about using Markdown or whatever, but I didn't know about that at the time.) <strong>However, I wasn't able to conveniently take advantage of auto-closing tags because I would have to wait a few seconds for it to happen</strong>, which was simply too long.</p>
              <p>At the time, I was typing up my math notes onto my website. I used MathJax to render math symbols and equations. Here's the thing: typing up notes for a whole math course leads to <em>a lot</em> of math symbols. <strong>Every time I wanted to test my changes, I would have to refresh the page and wait a full minute for the symbols to fully render.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Another slight inconvenience was the lack of home and end keys, which I often use to quickly navigate to the start or end of a line.</strong> A workaround for that is using the shift key though. One more slight keyboard inconvenience was the lack of a numpad, which prevented me from typing alt-codes. I also thought having no caps-lock button would bother me, but it never did.</p>
              <p>Recently, another option to code on a Chromebook appeared in the form of Crostini, which allows you to run Linux apps on ChromeOS, meaning you don't have to install Linux to run apps like Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, and Gimp. I personally like this option the best.</p>
              <p>Conclusion: Getting a Chromebook for coding is a good option if you're out a lot and/or you don't want to spend a lot of money on a laptop. It can handle running a Linux environment just fine. The dealbreaker is speed and (maybe) storage space.</p>

            <h4 class="title">Rough Neighborhood</h4>
            <h6 class="date">February 13, 2019</h6>
            <p>"Ok, I’m dropping you off here."<br>"What? C’mon man, it’s like 200 degrees out there!"<br>"Look, I almost got shot once. I’m not tryna get shot again."<br>"Ok, fine. Thanks for the ride."<br>"See ya."</p>
            <p>Well, there I was. Hundreds of blocks away from my house. It was a long walk home. It always was.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseRoughNeighborhood">
              <p>Instinctively, I swung my backpack off my shoulders and opened the small hidden pocket inside, sneaking out my switchblade and can of pepper spray. I slid them into the pockets of my pants. I learned to do all this with my eyes focused everywhere except my backpack; it prevented anyone from sneaking up on me.</p>
              <p>With my hands in my pockets and head down, I started walking. It was 3:00 PM. On cue, the door to the Corner Mart opened and a teenager rushed out, carrying a pack of cigarettes and a brown bag — undoubtedly hiding a bottle of beer. It wasn’t for him; it was for “The Judge”, his dad. Everyone knew The Judge. He was a major alcoholic, but he made a killing selling drugs. You went to him for the soft stuff, like weed. You went to him for the hard stuff, like cocaine and heroin. He had it all. God knew where he got all of it, but no one questioned it as long as the supply was there. I don’t think anybody ever actually saw him either, except for maybe his dealers and his son. His wife was out of the picture; no one knew what happened to her, but there were rumors that she was killed by The Judge for trying to turn him in to the cops.</p>
              <p>You always heard stories like that and — if you were lucky enough — you witnessed those wild, crazy, scary stories. You never talked about them though. Not with anyone. Talking too much could get you into trouble.</p>
              <p>As I crossed the street, I turned my head, quickly glancing behind me. No one. That was the good thing about the extreme heat: no one wanted to be in it.</p>
              <p>There was a broken old bus stop sign up ahead. Well, only people who lived there long enough knew that it used to be one. The bus system used to service the area; I actually used to take the bus. At some point, I started being greeted by different drivers each time. The previous ones I never saw again. I guess they stopped servicing the area when they couldn't find anyone who wanted to drive there. Shortly after that, some people colored the signs with obscenities and even bent and twisted the pole, like they were trying to rip it off.</p>
              <p>Another thing about living there was that you had to strike a balance between being strong, but not too strong. Too weak and people would stomp all over you. Too strong and people would want to prove that <em>they</em> were the alpha dog. I have the frame of a soccer player, so usually I was good. The best thing I did though was making it a habit to constantly knit my brows and frown. I never got jumped since.</p>
              <p>Again, I quickly glanced behind me. There were two men in the distance, both wearing white shirts and dark low-hanging shorts, and they were walking my way. I didn’t look long enough to see if I recognized them. That was another thing you didn’t do: stare. I quickened my pace to get away from them, but not fast enough to look like I was running away. Suddenly, a deafening crack filled my ears. Gunshot? No, just some firecrackers, probably set off by those two guys.</p>
              <p>Up ahead, there was another corner store. That one was closed down, but there were always several guys just hanging out there, smoking a pack and drinking a bottle. They used to be friends with the owner before he got run over in a drive-by. After that, they met up there every day to remember him. I nodded my head at them as I walked by, and they nodded their heads back.</p>
              <p>Turning the corner, I found a car with shattered windows. Poor guy probably locked the doors. There were three rules regarding cars. Rule 1: Don’t get a car. Rule 2: If you do get a car, don’t lock the doors unless you want to keep paying for new windows. Rule 3: Never keep any valuables in your car. Most people, including me, followed the first rule. As I walked by, the door opened and a fat man stumbled out, clinging tightly to his bottle.</p>
              <p>"Hey, man, can I use your phone?"<br>"Don’t have one."<br>"Hey, come on —"</p>
              <p>Rushing past the fat drunkard to avoid more conversation, I noticed another man coming towards me. A man I didn’t recognize. He was walking fast with his hood up and hands in his hoodie pocket. Anyone out in that heat with a hood on their head and their hands in pockets was trouble. Normally, I would have turned around and walked the other way, but the way he had his hands in his pockets made me think he was carrying a gun. Running away might have made him think I was gonna snitch. Hoping he’d just ignore me, I kept my watch on him without staring at him. Tensing my body a little, I moved my hands towards my pockets, but not all the way in. When he was within arm’s distance of me, he pulled out of his pocket a small bloodstained knife. Immediately, I aimed my switchblade and pepper spray at his face. Seeing me armed, he put his knife back and quickly rushed past me, leaving behind a smell of weed.</p>
              <p>As I approached my house, the blue and red of the police cars lit up the area. I was able to make out four women, who looked like they had been abused, standing with some police officers. At the house next to mine, police officers were dragging out a whole bunch of men, handcuffed with guns pointed to their heads. Behind them were more police officers, carrying a ton of weapons and drugs. I never knew what was going on in that house, but guys would always be coming in and out at the middle of the night, smelling like weed. My brother later told me that they were running a brothel, keeping the women hooked on drugs and threatening them if they ever left the house.</p>
              <p>To people who’ve never lived in a rough neighborhood like mine, this is my story. This was the challenge I faced on a day-to-day basis: just avoiding trouble. This is the experience that has stayed with me.</p>

            <h4 class="title">Observations as an Instructor Aide for a Beginning iOS Class</h4>
            <h6 class="date">February 2, 2019</h6>
            <p>I'm currently an instructor aide for a beginning iOS programming class. It is a very hands-on class where the instructor projects his code onto a large screen and the students follow along on their computers. It is also an interesting class because <em>the students start typing lines of code before learning the fundamentals of coding</em>, like variables, loops, and functions. Here are my observations — in light of the aforementioned situation — from working with students with no prior programming experience.</p>
            <p>Some students:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Worry about making sure line numbers match with the instructor's</li>
              <li>Mistakenly type code outside of functions (sometimes as a result with trying to match line numbers)</li>
              <li>Don't close opening curly braces</li>
              <li>Don't put opening curly braces after an if statement</li>
              <li>Are not experienced with typing on a keyboard (and, as a result, fall behind)</li>
              <li>Misspell variable names without realizing and run into uninitialized variables when copying the instructor's code</li>
              <li>Copy the instructor's comments verbatim without realizing that comments aren't code</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Sometimes I:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Tend to give nonspecific instructions like "Do this" or "Can you go (move your mouse) over here?" instead of "Can you resize the window so we can see the error message?"</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="title">Writing Math Notes</h4>
            <h6 class="date">January 30, 2019</h6>
            <p>This idea came to my mind as I observed a student trying to understand how to add fractions. She had all the steps written out — namely, multiplying the numerator and denominator by a factor of the LCD. She had the steps in her notes; she had the steps on her homework. But she didn't understand why we were doing that step.</p>
            <p>She raised her hand twice throughout the lesson to ask about it. Of course, asking questions is a good thing, but the fact that she asked about the same thing twice made me wonder if she was retaining the information. Now, adding fractions isn't always an easy thing to do, so it's expected to take some time to understand.</p>
            <p>What I was wondering though, was if she had written out the reason <i>in words</i> in her notes, would she have understood it better?</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseWritingMathNotes">
              <p>Many students in a math class are likely to take notes by copying verbatim (is there a word for copying "number for number"?) whatever is on the board. As a result, notes end up being pages full of numbers. Looking back at pages of numbers is kinda hard to understand, especially weeks or months after taking those notes. Also, teachers tend to verbally explain things while writing, but the verbal explanation doesn't make it to the board. They'll say, "We can only add fractions if the denominators are the same" without writing that. As a result, students won't write down that important piece of information. Looking back at notes and seeing a bunch of steps and numbers doesn't automatically reflect "making the denominators the same". "Wait, why did we multiply by 5?", "We went from this step to this step, but I don't remember why."</p>
              <p>Moreover, if students are doing in-class problems in their notes and they make a mistake, they're likely to just cross it out and write the correct step(s). They might figure out where/why they went wrong at that moment, but forget weeks or months later. Looking back at just some steps crossed out next to the correct steps doesn't immediately remind them of what misconception they were holding on to.</p>
              <p>What I imagine would help — and have recently found helpful for me — is <i>taking notes in both numbers and words</i>. Copying down the steps, and writing down the teacher's verbal justification for each step.</p>
              <p>"Adding fractions needs same denominators. Find LCD so they have same denominators"</p>
              <p>"IMPORTANT: do PEMDAS inside parentheses"</p>
              <p>"Multiplying fractions: multiply across"</p>
              <p>I'm also seeing open-notes tests slowly becoming a thing. Having those words written out — especially colored or in big letters — makes looking through notes much faster. It's easy to remember to make the denominators the same when adding fractions if you read it rather than studying numbers carefully to <i>deduce</i> that.</p>
              <p>They say writing things out helps with retention. I think it's better to remember words than it is to remember a bunch of numbers.</p>
              <p>P.S. Unless those numbers are digits of pi.</p>

            <h6 class="date">January 29, 2019</h6>
            <p>Why is 2 % 3 (2 mod 3) = 2? I easily knew 4 % 3 = 1 when I first started learning programming. I remember asking a friend about it, but he wasn't exactly sure either. He did tell me, "I guess if the number on the left is smaller, then it's just equal to that number." I definitely use that shortcut whenever I encounter modulus problems. But I don't think that explanation flies with people who really want to know why 2 % 3 = 2.</p>

            <p>We're told by teachers — or at least I was — that using the phrase "I think" or "I believe" or any other variant of that in our writing is pointless. "I think that schools should start later." Of course you think that, you wrote it on your paper! You don't have to say "I think"; the paper's written by you, so we're gonna assume that that's what you believe!</p>
            <p>I see how that makes sense, especially for papers with word limits. But I think (hah!) that sometimes not saying "I think" removes the personal touch. Cuz sometimes I want to state something that I think, but I don't want it to sound like I'm an expert or anything. "I think bilingual education is good." vs. "Bilingual education is good." See what I mean? Well, anyway, that's what I think.</p>

              <p>"Yeah, physics is hard. I dropped out of that class when I took it."</p>
              <p>"Really? <i>You</i> think physics is hard?" M was doubtful or relieved. Or a bit of both.</p>

              <p>"Well, my advice to you is to go ask your teacher for help. Like during lunch or afterschool or something. Just go into his room and ask him for help."</p>
              <p>"But I don't wanna go in there and have it be all like, 'What do you need help with?' 'Everything!'"</p>
              <p>"Yeah, that's why you go now. You start early so he doesn't have to go through so much."</p>
              <p>"Ok, I'll try going early. I'm not good at school. I don't know what I want to do with my life."</p>

              <p>"Yeah, see. I still don't know what to do in the future."</p>
              <p>"What subjects do you like then? Like, English or history?"</p>
              <p>"I don't really like anything. It's just easy or hard. That's it. Like, I don't <i>like</i> English, but it's easy. I don't think anyone likes any subject."</p>
              <p>"I like math.", said G.</p>
              <p>"Really? You <i>like</i> math? You use it at home?" M was skeptical. Admittedly, I was a bit too at first, but still ready to make a case for G.</p>
              <p>"Yeah, I use it all the time when I draw. Like, I just keep drawing patterns and measuring stuff. It's all patterns."</p>

              <p>"They actually tell you they don't care? Or you can tell that they don't care?", I asked.</p>
              <p>"I can tell they don't care. They don't tell me to do good in school. They just be like, 'just do yo thing'."</p>
              <p>"Well, why do you care about doing good in school?"</p>

            <p>He stared at the door. The door stared back at him. He put his hand on the handle. Then he took it off. He wasn't nervous before, but being one step away brought the reality of it all back to him. One step away from a totally new world. At that moment, he wished he was home. Not just his apartment several miles away. But back home. Where the smell of his favorite foods was always in the air. Where all his favorite places were just around the corner. Where all the people he saw were familiar faces. Where he felt at home.</p>
            <p>He put his hand on the handle once again and slowly pushed the door forward.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseBarnga">
              <p>All eyes turned on him. Their paralyzing stares held him in place. In an attempt to avoid them, he looked around the room, darting his eyes back and forth, focusing on nothing in particular. As long as he couldn't see their eyes drilling into him, he felt a bit calmer. A bit less alien. He didn't know where to go though, so he stood there fixed in place until he saw the teacher motion for him to take a seat in an empty chair. He sat down. On his left, a student turned to him and acknowledged him with a simple <i>"hey"</i>. He didn't understand but smiled back politely anyway.</p>
              <p>Before he could adjust to his new surroundings, the teacher continued talking. He didn't understand, but smiled back politely whenever the teacher looked his way. For a brief minute, he finally felt comfortable. Now that he was where he was supposed to be, he could focus on moving forward. But the brief comfort gave way to worry. What happens now? What's supposed to happen? What do I do next?</p>
              <p>He didn't know the rules. Was he allowed to raise his hand for assistance? Judging by everyone's silence, he probably wasn't allowed to talk. Which was probably a good thing since he didn't know what to say anyway.</p>
              <p>All of a sudden, the teacher stopped talking. He looked around and saw several hands go up. Was he supposed to raise his hand too? One student spoke and the teacher smiled and nodded, seemingly in agreement and approval. What did she say? What did the teacher ask? He felt his face getting warmer. What if he was the only one who didn't know the answer?</p>
              <p>The anxiety. The confusion. The embarrassment. The swirl of emotions rushing through his head and chest made him feel sick inside. He couldn't take it anymore. Without warning, he jumped out of his seat and ran out of the classroom. He didn't know where he was running to, but he just wanted to get as far away from the classroom as possible. The tears forming in his eyes made it hard for him to see. He turned a corner and crashed into someone. Quickly, he got up and started apologizing repeatedly. He didn't stop to think that the person probably wouldn't understand him. He just kept apologizing.</p>
              <p><i>"Stop it already. I'm fine. How about you, are you ok?"</i></p>
              <p>He didn't answer. Not because he didn't understand what he was saying. But because he actually understood what he was saying. It was the first time he heard someone speak his language since coming to school. Wiping away the tears from his eyes, he smiled at him and said, <i>"Yeah, everything's ok now."</i></p>

            <h4 class="title">Language Barriers</h4>
            <h6 class="date">October 26, 2018</h6>
            <p>(Note: I use double quotes for thoughts and spoken words and single quotes for written and typed words.)</p>
            <p>Today was the first time I truly met a student dealing with a language barrier. It was interesting, to say the least.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseLanguageBarrier">
              <p>I knew that being in a community where the minorities were a majority meant that English might not have been some students' first language. But that had never seemed to be a major problem for me or the students before. Admittedly, I tend to assume every student can speak and understand English enough to learn the material.</p>
              <p>2nd period started with the teacher handing out to each student a paper with grid coordinates on it and a line. Their task: find the slope of the line and draw a line with slope 2/5. I walked around the room, looking at how students solved the problem. Most were drawing horizontal and vertical lines from one point on the line to another point on the line. Some correctly concluded that the slope was 3/1 or 3. Others mixed up the definition of slope and got 1/3. One student's paper caught my eye in particular. She had drawn two triangles, but it wasn't apparent what they were for or what they were measuring. Just two arbitrary triangles on the line. At first I thought, "Wow, I've never seen anyone solve for slope like this."</p>
              <p>When the students were done, they went to the back of the classroom and put their paper in one of three boxes. One was labeled: 'I understand the material and could teach it to someone else'. Most of the students who finished early put their papers in this box. Most of them were right. The second box was labeled something along the lines of: 'I almost understand the material, but I'm still a little fuzzy'. Some of the papers in this box were right. The third box was labeled: 'I don't understand the material'. This box had the fewest papers. When I looked at the top one, the paper turned out to be the one with the two triangles. Maybe she didn't know what the triangles were for either.</p>
              <p>After this, the teacher had students get laptops. I wasn't sure what they needed them for. I didn't really pay too much attention to it. Some time later, the teachers paired up students to work with each other on the slope problem they were doing earlier. The students who got the correct answer got matched with those who got the wrong answer. The students who got the correct answer were leaders who helped their partner by asking guided questions to help them think about how to solve the problem.</p>
              <p>In my casual stroll around the room, I ended up near the student who had drawn triangles. Sitting around her were two other girls, who appeared to be trying to help her. I walked closer to them to observe. I looked at the laptop in front of them, and it was open to Google Translate. What was more shocking was the language they were translating to. 'What is the slope of the line?' translated into a collection of swirly symbols I had never seen before. That's when I realized the student who had drawn triangles — the student who had put her paper in the 'I don't understand the material' box — didn't understand English.</p>
              <p>I watched in awe as the girls tried to get her to copy one of their papers to show her how to do the problem. The magnitude of the situation was overwhelming. She doesn't understand what the teacher and her classmates are saying, and there's nobody around who spoke Amharic.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the girls' efforts weren't successful. When the teacher decided to move on, I asked if I could work with her individually. Upon his approval, I sat down next to her and opened up Google Translate on my phone.</p>
              <p>Before, when I was watching the girls help her, I had a suspicion that she didn't know what a line was, which was pretty important because the definition of slope — as they were taught — is vertical length / horizontal length. I typed into Google Translate: 'Do you know what a line is?'. She shook her head. I drew a line on her paper. "This is a line". Repeating the pencil motion, I repeated, "line". Softly, she repeated, "line". 'Can you draw a line?'. She drew a line on her paper just as I had.</p>
              <p>"How long is the line?". She looked at me blankly. 'How long is the line?'. Still no response. I drew two points on the line and told her that it was "1". I drew another point and asked her again. "2". "From here to here?". "3". I drew another line. "How long is this line?". 'How long is this line?'. "4". "How long is this line?". "1".</p>
              <p>She now seemed to be able to measure the length of lines. Then I wanted to make sure she understood the concept of horizontal lines and vertical lines. 'Do you know what horizontal means?'. She nodded. 'Do you know what vertical means?'. She nodded again. "What type of line is this? Is it horizontal or vertical?". No response. I asked again, this time moving my pencil in the corresponding motion. "Horizontal? Or vertical?". "Horizontal", she replied softly. I pointed to a vertical line. "Horizontal? Or vertical?". "Vertical".</p>
              <p>I moved on to the concept of points. 'Do you know what a point is?'. She shook her head. I drew a point on her paper. "This is a point.". "Point". 'Can you draw a point?'. She successfully drew a dot on the paper. Sliding my finger along the line, I asked, "Can you draw a point on this line?". 'Can you draw a point on this line?'. She drew a (good) point on the line. I was ecstatic. "Can you draw another point on this line?". She then drew a (bad) point on the line. My heart dropped. Well, at least it was on the line. I had absolutely no idea how to explain that the points she should be drawing had to be on the line <em>and</em> where the grid points were.</p>
              <p>The teacher then told everyone to pack up. Quickly, I moved back to lines and lengths. "How long is this line?". 'How long is this line?'. "4", she said. "Is it horizontal or vertical?". "Vertical". I made the up-down-left-right motion and asked again, "Horizontal or vertical?". "Horizontal". "How long is this line?". "3". "Horizontal or vertical?". "Vertical".</p>
              <p>With that I ended our little session and she packed up and left. That session was pretty enlightening though. I never realized how hard it was for non-native English speakers to learn. I never realized how hard it was to teach someone who didn't speak English.</p>

            <h6 class="date">October 22, 2018</h6>
            <p>Imagine you're sledding down a hill with your favorite stuffed tiger. Those familiar with the reference will know that this hill is dangerous. There are many trees and rocks you have to avoid. Being the amazing six-year-old that you are, you manage to avoid them in the beginning. Also, being the philosophical six-year-old that you are, you're probably busy asking your companion deep questions about life. Too busy to notice the ledge. Of course, you fall off of it. And the comic would end with you buried face-flat under the snow and pinning the blame on your tiger.</p>
            <p>But I'm not Bill Watterson so this comic takes a different turn.</p>
            <p>Somehow, the sled breaks into two when it lands on the ground and you're standing on both pieces, one foot on each side. Then, by some unfortunate phenomenon, the ground below you splits, leaving a giant fissure between your feet.</p>
            <p>Now you're speeding down a hill essentially on two different paths. What now?</p>

            <p>The familiar feeling grabs a hold of me. It's the feeling of excitement mixed with longing. It's the feeling of "I can't wait!" and "Just one more week. Please!"</p>
            <p>It's like an ocean suddenly in high tide. Without even realizing it, I somehow got dragged so far out. And with every passing second, I end up deeper in the ocean. Exceeding the line of balance between excitement and fear. Excitement because I'm adventurous, but fear because I'm not that great at swimming. So before I'm too deep, I try to swim back to shore. To comfort.</p>
            <p>But everytime the waves ebb away, they push me back out. Like I'm not allowed to be where I once was.</p>
            <p>Here I am now, stranded out at sea. It's calm and quiet. It's peaceful. Heck, it even smells nice. It'll do. But I know pretty soon, the waves will push me back to shore. It always has.</p>
            <p>I guess I better enjoy it while I can. This might be my last time going out to sea.</p>

            <h6 class="date">September 10, 2018</h6>
            <p>So I had to replace some kitchen countertop tiles recently. It was hard, to say the least. Keep in mind that I have no experience whatsoever with stuff like this.</p>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="./pictures/writings/tiled/tile_start.jpg">
            <p>I have no idea when and how that ever happened. To make things worse, I have no idea where the piece went.</p>
            <p>For some reason, my mind jumped to making a crescent-shaped piece somehow. It would've been much easier to glue it on than to remove and replace the tiles.</p>
            <p>But alas, there were no crescent-shaped tiles.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseTiled">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="./pictures/writings/tiled/tile_mid_1.jpeg">
              <p>Yep. By removing one tile, I made the problem worse. The hole — originally spanning across two tiles — now spanned across three tiles. Great. Just great.</p>
              <p>Removing one tile was hard enough. I mean, have you ever tried "sawing" through a rock with scissors? I imagine it's probably something like that.</p>
              <p>It's also hard mentally as well. It's demoralizing when you're sawing and prying away at a broken tile — which you never broke by the way — only to break pieces off of the perfectly good tiles next to it. Well, then you would have to take off those freshly ruined tiles. And oops. You just inevitably broke more pieces off of more good tiles next to those freshly ruined tiles.</p>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="./pictures/writings/tiled/tile_mid_2.jpg">
              <p>That was the third most satisfying thing to see in this whole experience.</p>
              <p>Did you know that it is difficult finding a store that stocks v-cap tiles in the size you need? That was the second most satisfying thing to see.</p>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="./pictures/writings/tiled/tile_end.jpg">
              <p>And that was the most satisfying thing to see.</p>

            <p>Reading through a somewhat recent email, I came across the word "anyway". The first time I had ever seen it used.</p>
            <p>I dismissed it the first time I read it. I really don't know why it didn't sound weird at the time. Anyways. Anyway. It sounds so weird without the 's'.</p>
            <p>Well, I just found out that "anyway" is actually correct, making "anyways" incorrect.</p>
            <p>Apparently, it's because "anyway" is an adverb, and adverbs can't be plural.</p>
            <p>Anyway, it's reminiscent of Kent Davison describing Daylight Saving Time: "It's neither plural nor possessive."</p>

            <p>Maybe it's because dancing is difficult. But then again, everything is difficult in the beginning.</p>
            <p>Maybe it's because I was worried about other people's (nonexistent) judgements. Well, that kinda went out the window when I cut my hair the way I did.</p>
            <p>Maybe it's because it required a surprisingly good amount of mental energy to do seemingly simple movements. Oh. Yeah. It. Did.</p>

            <p>Lately, I've been taking a page out of someone's book and going to restaurants by myself. It feels a bit weird walking into a restaurant alone and seeing families or groups of friends or couples seated at the tables. It feels a bit weird holding up my finger and saying "one" when I'm asked, "How many people?"</p>
            <p>I imagine it looks a bit weird to other people too. But I've stopped caring about what other people think of me since I cut my hair.</p>
            <p>He brings his hand to his nose and wipes the snowflake off. He looks up at the sky once more, hoping to see more snowflakes. Then he wakes up. Of course it was just a dream. Snow in the summer is just a bit weird.</p>

            <h4 class="title">Racketeering</h4>
            <h6 class="date">August 6, 2018</h6>
            <p>I've been coding a lot in Racket lately. Not for ThoughtSTEM, but for my own practice. I've mentioned several times — well, at least once anyways — that functional programming seemed hard to me. I might've also suggested that I didn't like Racket and functional programming.</p>
            <p>Well, I suppose you already know what this post is gonna be about.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseRacketeering">
              <p>I've also mentioned before that my mind about functional programming might change. It definitely is a change of pace. And a completely different way of thinking.</p>
              <p>The problems I've been solving were intended to be solved primarily in Java. At least, I think so, because they're from a beginner's programming competition at UCSD, and the first language you learn at UCSD is Java.</p>
              <p>I haven't done a whole bunch yet, but for most of the problems, I kept thinking about how much easier it would be to do them in an imperative style. (Another reason why I think they're intended to be solved using Java.) If you see a question involving checking whether a string has a character, one of the first thoughts to pop into your mind would probably be creating a simple loop to traverse the string and check each character. Easy-peasy.</p>
              <p>It's a bit frustrating when I hit a roadblock and I think, "This would be so much easier with a loop." or "This would be so much easier with variables." But forcing myself to turn away from those has improved my coding skills.</p>
              <p>For one, I am much more comfortable with recursion now. For some reason, I used to never be able to wrap my head around (and around and around and around) recursion. I mean, I knew that you needed a base case and a recursive call with a smaller input, but I never knew what to put for the base case and/or input. And the whole "going up the stack" or whatever used to confuse me too. (I was relieved when my professor said that loops are generally preferred over recursion because it's easier to debug a loop.)</p>
              <p>Another thing is that the code is more concise. Having outputs of functions be inputs of other functions make for a lot of one-liners. I mean, one-liners aren't necessarily signs of good code, but resorting to higher-level functions (I kinda am referring to higher-order functions and kinda not at the same time) that strip away the details of lower-level stuff, like loops and variable manipulations, sometimes makes code easier to understand than the lower-level code, which become confusing simply because there are so many lines. (E.g. recursively traversing a tree vs. looping through a tree.)</p>
              <p>With that said, I still don't see myself switching over to functional programming. It's a little bit like writing in cursive: it's not really done on a large scale (I don't think) and print writing is easier anyways. (Also like functional programming, cursive is arguably the better writing technique but harder to read.) I definitely do <a href="#see_how_it_works">see how it works</a> though. A little bit more anyways.</p>

            <h6 class="date">July 26, 2018</h6>
            <p>That's not to say that learning programming languages is pointless. Just that computer science knowledge/expertise shouldn't be measured by the number or popularity of languages one knows. (Except for MATLAB and HTML/CSS. Those aren't "real" programming languages. According to jokes anyways lol.)</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseLearningHowToCodeP2">
              <p>Especially with the high school students, most of whom having had significant programming experience (is that grammatically correct? I suspect not.), getting through a module/quest has been very easy because they easily understood what was going on. While one other student has said Racket was easier than imperative programming languages, I think they were getting it not because of the "easiness" of Racket, but because of something else. (I still don't think Racket is easier than imperative programming languages, but that's my heavily biased — and somewhat stubborn — opinion.)</p>
              <p>Because of something else. What is that something else? It lies in (one of) the goal(s) of Morugamu, which aims to teach computer science without the computer. It sounds weird, doesn't it? Maybe because learning computer science seems to be associated with learning how to work/talk with computers or knowing how to code in a dozen programming languages. But knowing how to do those things requires something more basic. Ah, there's that "something" again.</p>
              <p>Admittedly, I've imagined scenarios involving confused (at the least) parents wondering about why their children weren't learning Python or whatever when Python — or whatever — was in the name of the class. I don't think my answer is better than that of whoever is answering that question.</p>
              <p>My response would've been 'something' like, "learning how to code is more about developing logical reasoning skills — and, more generally, developing a programming mindset — than learning a language."</p>
              <p>Ah, there's that "something" again.</p>

            <p>As it gets further into the week, and ultimately into the summer, my thoughts on learning computer science — and what it actually is — are slowly changing.</p>
            <p>When I found out I would be helping out with camps teaching Python and Java and virtual reality and Android apps and web design, I didn't think it would all be done in Racket. I imagine the students didn't think that either. Oh, and their parents too, of course.</p>
            <p>I initially thought that was unfortunate for the students. I mean, they're working with a language they're unlikely to see or use again; and if they were to learn Java or Python, their experience with Racket wouldn't really be of much use. The same way learning a language that compiles to Javascript isn't the same as learning Javascript.</p>
            <p>But I watched the students learn. I watched them vigorously copying code from the slides. I watched them work through their errors and learn from their mistakes. And I watched them create awesome things from whole worlds to explore in virtual reality to creative websites featuring their favorite games or TV shows, and proudly showing them off to everyone.</p>
            <p>They were just getting familiar with the material and then running off with their imagination to build whatever they desired.</p>
            <p>Which, I think, is what learning how to code is really about.</p>

            <p>As a CS undergrad, you should try to learn a language that isn't used in industry. Sounds like crippling advice to me.</p>
            <p>Don't get me wrong, I don't disagree with this. I agree to some extent. Also, I don't mean to offend the person who said this. (I actually greatly admire him.) It just seems counterintuitive at first.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseIndustry">
              <p>I guess it's because, from my perspective, going to college for a CS degree means gaining the skills necessary to work in industry, i.e. college is a job-preparation thing for students pursuing a CS degree.</p>
              <p>The opposite would be college is a place for learning as much as possible for the sake of learning rather than for the sake of getting a job. Being a Math-CS major, I've experienced both sides of the spectrum.</p>
              <p>I say it's crippling advice because I imagine telling CS students to learn a language not used in industry and seeing them balk at the idea. They would probably call it a waste of time because they could've used that time to learn something "useful". Or maybe they would say that it makes them undesirable because they know some no-name language while everyone around them is scribbling away in Python, Java, C, C++, Javascript.</p>
              <p>Everyone will inadvertently have to be better than the next CS student to get a job in industry. And how do they get a job in industry? By working with the tools used in industry. After all, if you're a company working primarily with Java, you would want to hire someone experienced in Java. I presume.</p>
              <p>And, also, if we don't get a job by the time we graduate, our lives are officially over. Heh.</p>

            <h4 class="title">Brought to You Today by the Number 9 (and by the letters C and S)</h4>
            <h6 class="date">July 18, 2018</h6>
            <p>For the past 3 weeks, I've been riding my skateboard or bike — depending on the week — to get the mail. This week is skateboard week. Today, however, I came home a bit late and decided to walk instead.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseNine">
              <p>My skateboard is kinda loud already and riding over cracks in the sidewalk just makes it even louder. It was a little after 8:30, so I thought maybe there were children sleeping — or getting ready to go to sleep. (I suspect that the area I live in is half families and half students.) I have no idea if that is true; I only thought that because I remember I had to go to bed around 9 when I was younger.</p>
              <p>It was about 10-13 years ago, but I remember that because I would lie in bed and stare at my digital clock. It wasn't because I couldn't sleep; it was because I was doing mental math with the numbers on the clock. Specifically, division. I don't remember if I liked doing division or not, but, for some reason, I stayed up doing it. The numbers were aligned so that I could imagine a division bar (whatever it's called) between the hour and the minutes and do division by 9.</p>
              <p>I did this so often that I eventually came up with an algorithmic way of dividing (two digit) numbers by 9. It went something along the lines of: the first digit of the quotient is going to be the first digit of the dividend. So, for 23 &divide; 9, the first digit of the answer is going to be 2. For 34 &divide; 9, the first digit of the answer is 3. I was excited about my discovery until the time was something like 9:29.</p>
              <p>I modified my algorithm: if the digits of the dividend add up to 9 or greater, then the first digit of the quotient is going to be 1 greater than the first digit of the dividend. So, for 29 &divide; 9, the first digit of the answer is going to be 3, since 2 + 9 = 11 &ge; 9.</p>
              <p>For the second digit, it was the sum of the digits of the dividend. So, for 23 &divide; 9, the in-progress answer would be 2.5 since 2 + 3 = 5. For 34 &divide; 9, the in-progress answer would be 3.7 since 3 + 4 = 7. For edge cases, like 29 &divide; 9, the in-progress answer would be 3.2 since 2 + 9 = 11 and 1 + 1 = 2. For 58 &divide; 9, the in-progress answer would be 6.4 since 5 + 8 = 13 and 1 + 3 = 4.</p>
              <p>I don't think I was able to stay up after 9:58.</p>
              <p>It was by creating that algorithm (especially the second digit part) that I inadvertently memorized single digit division by 9. 1/9 = .111..., 2/9 = .222..., 7/9 = .777...</p>
              <p>What I didn't realize — until now (almost literally) — was that I was using fundamental computer science concepts in creating my algorithm. Well, first of all, by creating an algorithm. But also by using "if statements" for special cases. And also by generalizing the algorithm so that it worked for any digits. It worked as long as I was in bed and awake between 9:10 and 9:59 anyways.</p>
              <p>It wasn't a very useful algorithm. (I'm pretty proud of it though lol.) But it was fascinating to me at the time. What's most surprising to me is that I developed that way of thinking with no exposure to computer science. Well, whatever computer science is.</p>

            <h4 class="title">See How It Works?</h4>
            <h6 class="date">July 14, 2018</h6>
            <p>Recently, I was asked to proofread an essay to check for grammatical errors. My friend has always been asking me to do so throughout high school and college. And it's always been the same every time: receive his horrible essay by email and trudge through it, stopping every few seconds to cry as I try to understand what he's saying and see how to fix it.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseSeeHowItWorks">
              <p>Joking aside, this time was a little different. I only cried every few minutes. Ok, no more jokes.</p>
              <p>(On an unrelated note, it was different for another reason. When I proofread my friend's paper, I sometimes tease him through my comments only because he knows I'm not really making fun of him. What I didn't know was that this was my friend's friend's paper. Oops.)</p>
              <p>This time was different because one of the first thoughts that popped into my mind was functional programming.</p>
              <p>Having been working with Racket for the past 3 weeks, functional programming has been on my mind lately. I'm still not sure of what functional programming is actually. I guess it's partly because I'm a little uncomfortable with functional programming. I still prefer imperative programming, but only because I've been doing it for the past 4 years. My mind may change.</p>
              <p>The reason I thought of functional programming when asked to proofread for grammar was because I thought they were related. Pretty closely related. I think successfully working with them follows from knowing how to visualize the structure of their elements. (Though that could be said of almost any subject really.)</p>
              <p>Racket is driven by parentheses. Thus, getting programs to work correctly requires knowing where to put them. (For some students, it's been knowing <i>how many</i> parentheses are needed.) In fact, it's probably the main source of problems among students. At first, the biggest issue is missing the ')'. But, later on in the week, it becomes putting the ')' too early, cutting off the rest of the code and causing it to not show up on the program.</p>
              <p>Because of it's list-like nature, it's very easy to get lost in the code and see where you have to put the ')'. Knowing how to visualize the pieces of code might possibly solve ~99% of problems involving parentheses. (The 1% is knowing when to start code with '('.) By knowing when to close off parentheses, you start seeing a Racket file as pieces of code put together rather than one long wall of code.</p>
              <p>Grammar is also very dependent on structure. The biggest fundamental mistakes I think are issues with incomplete sentences and run-on sentences. Being able to visualize sentences as parts solve* these — and many others — issues. Specifically, being able to recognize the subject(s), verb(s), and modifer(s). (*I intentionally made a grammar mistake in the third sentence of this paragraph to prove a point. I intentionally made a grammar mistake in the fourth sentence of this paragraph for style reasons. <a href="#grammar_rules">#grammar_rules</a>) Yeah, I enjoyed making <a href="http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/diagrams2/one_pager1.htm" target="_blank">sentence diagrams</a> in my English class.</p>
              <p>In terms of Racket, incomplete sentences would be closing off parentheses too early and run-on sentences would be not knowing when to close off parentheses.</p>
              <p>I don't necessarily think being good at grammar implies being good at (functional) programming and vice versa. Actually, I would be surprised if there was some correlation. I do think being good at visualizing pieces of the whole will help in understanding what is going on though.</p>

            <h4 class="title">What's the Difference?</h4>
            <h6 class="date">July 12, 2018</h6>
            <p>"There is a difference between 'creepy' and 'disgusting'."</p>
            <p>A friend said that today in response to an amusing (not serious, not inappropriate) situation. That sentence immediately brought back a memory of one of my most thought-provoking experiences that had been unintentionally suppressed for several years.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseDifference">
              <p>I know I said it was one of the most thought-provoking experiences, but I unfortunately don't remember a lot of the details. I do remember it happened in my AP English Language and Composition class. On that day, we got back our papers. I don't remember the topic, but it had something to do with analyzing the author's choice of word usage. Specifically, why the author chose to use two different words when they both had the same meaning. I really wish I could remember those words right now.</p>
              <p>They were pretty much synonyms, so that's what I wrote in my paper. One had a slightly more subtle darker/negative connotation I think, but, to me, they meant the same thing.</p>
              <p>"Why are there two different words for the same thing then?" That's more or less what my teacher wrote on my paper in his messy-but-readable, authoritative handwriting. I was mind-blown. It got me thinking about how there are words that are interchangeable because they mean the same thing and why they even exist in the first place. Like, why did we need to have multiple versions of the same word if that word was perfectly fine to use?</p>
              <p>There might be an obvious difference between "creepy" and "disgusting". I don't really know how to explain what the difference is, but I guess one would be more appropriate in different situations. Regardless, my initial, immediate mental response to my friend's statement was, "Yeah, they are two different words for a reason."</p>

            <p>Here's an interesting experiment. Answer polar questions (yes-no questions) with only "yes" or "no". That's it. No extra justification or additional confirmation. Just "yes" or "no". Sounds simple enough, doesn't it?</p>
            <p>Yes.</p>

            <h4 class="title">The Point of Some Return</h4>
            <h6 class="date">June 21, 2018</h6>
            <p>The concept of "return" is a difficult one. To understand and to explain.</p>
            <p>When I first started learning how to code, I did not understand what return meant. No matter how many times the professor went over it (he wasn't bad!), I just couldn't wrap my head around it. I don't remember exactly — or even vaguely, for that matter — what words he used to explain what return does. I do remember the context in which it was introduced though.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseReturn">
              <p><code>public int addTwo(int x) {<br>&ensp; int y = x + 2;<br>&ensp; return y;<br>}</code></p>
              <p>Not the exact example, but something more or less like this was on the slides. Just a random function that did something and returned a value. Whatever return meant. If I had to guess, I imagine the professor explained return by saying it "passed back the value" or "sends the value back" or something. Back WHERE?? WHERE did the value go when it was "returned"?</p>
              <p>The curious thing about explaining return is that it's really hard to explain in words without restating the definition of return.</p>
              <p>Of course, the concept of return totally makes sense to me now. But I still don't really know how to explain it. In words anyways. If I had to try to explain it, I would probably give an example and hope that it makes sense.</p>
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-5">
                  <p><code>public int addTwo(int x) {<br>&ensp; int y = x + 2;<br>&ensp; return y;<br>}<br>int a = addTwo(3);</code></p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-3">
                  <p>Or in Python:<br>(Which might be easier to understand)</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-3">
                  <p><code>def addTwo(x):<br>&ensp; y = x + 2<br>&ensp; return y<br><br>a = addTwo(3)</code></p>
                </div>
              </div>
              <p>In either case, a is equal to 5.</p>
              <p>Seeing that extra line at the end (<code>a = addTwo(3)</code>) <i>along</i> with the function definition is when I finally understood return.</p>
              <p>Hmm. Now that I think about it, I could explain return without restating the definition. I would say that return is the output of a function. Besides being a piece of code that is reused to perform a task - or being <a href="#something_that_does_something">something that does something</a> - a function is like a machine that takes in an input and spits out an output. Return is what does the spitting out.</p>
              <p>2/1/2019: I believe he said something like, "return sends the value back to the caller". At the time, I had no idea what a "caller" was.</p>

            <p>I feel so weird. So unknowledgeable. So helpless.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseImagine">
              <p>I’m a math major, so a problem like “What is (2+3i)(3+4i)” shouldn’t be too hard right? (Well, one doesn’t have to be a math major to know this). Solving this, I get:</p>
              <p>(2 × 3) + (2 × 4i) + (3i × 3) + (3i × 4i) = 6 + 8i + 9i + 12i<sup>2</sup> = 6 + 17i + 12i<sup>2</sup> = -6 + 17i</p>
              <p>Wait, what happened to the 12i<sup>2</sup>?</p>
              <p>I, along with students learning about imaginary numbers could just tell you that i<sup>2</sup> is actually equal to -1.</p>
              <p>The operative word being just.</p>
              <p>Why in the world is i<sup>2</sup> = -1? I don’t know — it just is.</p>
              <p>I’ve never really thought about what ‘i’ was. That’s why I feel so weird.</p>
              <p>I’ve never really thought about why i<sup>2</sup> = -1. That’s why I feel so unknowledgeable.</p>
              <p>I don’t really know how to explain why i<sup>2</sup> = -1. That’s why I feel so helpless.</p>
              <p>These emotions are bouncing around in my head in my Practicum in Math Tutoring class.  When we were told about “learning with meaning”, I was not expecting to feel this confused. Especially, for a topic that would normally be covered in 10 minutes (unfortunately). But this confusion only fueled my desire to realize the imaginary numbers.</p>
              <p>There's a constant battle in my head between "There must be an intuitive reason why i<sup>2</sup> = -1" and "It just is. That's the way you learned it, and that's how it shall be learned." Learning with meaning versus rote learning. It's so easy to end the battle now and give the victory to "that's the way things are".</p>
              <p>Though not deserving of the win, the latter is seemingly effective. Why spend so much time explaining why things work, when it takes so much less time to present as is? There’s only so much time to make sure these students pass these tests! It was certainly the mindset my AP Calculus teacher in high school adopted.</p>
              <p>He wasn’t a bad teacher. In fact, he was the exact opposite. Every student who has had him as a teacher will say that he is very smart, dedicated, hard-working, and caring. What other teacher would go to great lengths to provide us with notes he wrote himself to make calculus easier to read? What other teacher would make hundreds of copies of past AP exams for us to practice? What other teacher would write his own “handbook” and give them to us as study aids?</p>
              <p>We were learning calculus because of his efforts. For the past 9 years, more than 100 students, each year, have passed the AP exam, with an average of 127 students passing. His total class size each year was 150 or less. Surely, we were learning.</p>
              <p>With his dedication and concern for our success, it was obvious that there was nothing he would rather do than teach. Watching him and experiencing the results for myself made me feel the same way. I felt like I could’ve been in his shoes. And I wanted to too. Oh, except for the fact that I (then) hated public speaking.</p>
              <p>I’m still not great at it, but I’ve grown more comfortable with speaking in front of a crowd. So much so, that I recently realized the chance to help others have the same learning experience I did overshadowed my (now) dislike of public speaking. And that was before I experienced learning with meaning.</p>
              <p>So, what exactly is the “meaning” in “learning with meaning”? It is:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Drawing a number line</li>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="./pictures/writings/i/1.jpg">
                <li>Reminding that an arrow starting from 0 and pointing to 1 is “stretched” 5 times its length when multiplied by 5, and stretched in the other direction when multiplied by a negative number (or a rotation 180° counter-clockwise)</li>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="./pictures/writings/i/2.gif">
                <li>Asking “What number multiplied by itself twice gives -1?”</li>
                <li>Showing that the arrow starting from 0 and pointing to 1 can be rotated 180° counter-clockwise to point to -1 by multiplying 1 by a number (-1) once to get to -1</li>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="./pictures/writings/i/4.gif">
                <li>Showing that the arrow starting from 0 and pointing to 1 can be rotated 90° counter-clockwise, then rotated another 90° counter-clockwise to get to -1</li>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="./pictures/writings/i/5.gif">
                <li>Realizing that one rotation is one multiplication (from step #2) and two rotations is two multiplications (almost answering step #3)</li>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="./pictures/writings/i/6.gif">
                <li>Showing that when the arrow rotated 90° counter-clockwise, it pointed upward — not to any number on the number line. Not to anything in particular actually.</li>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="./pictures/writings/i/7.jpg">
                <li>Drawing a vertical number line extending upwards and downwards from that arrow and introducing it as the imaginary number line</li>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="./pictures/writings/i/8.jpg">
                <li>Showing again that the arrow starting from 0 and pointing to 1, when rotated once 90° counter-clockwise (one multiplication), points to some imaginary number, call it i</li>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="./pictures/writings/i/9.gif">
                <li>Reiterating that one 90° rotation was multiplying by i, so another 90° rotation is multiplying by i again</li>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="./pictures/writings/i/10.gif">
              </ol>
              <p>It’s certainly a lot easier to just say i<sup>2</sup> = -1, isn’t it?</p>
              <p>All of a sudden, the battle in my head ceases. The confusion fades away and is replaced by a newfound sense of empowerment. It’s a curious feeling. A little unusual, but also a little familiar. It’s the void of cluelessness and helplessness being filled with knowledge. Knowledge I never knew I needed.</p>

            <h4 class="title">Biking for the First Time</h4>
            <h6 class="date">June 7, 2018 (last updated on June 13, 2018)</h6>
            <p>So I rode a road bike for the first time today. It was absolutely amazing. And terrifying.</p>
            <p>Which came as a surprise to me. I learned how to ride a bike when I was like 7 or something. I've been cycling semi-seriously for maybe 7 years? Not 7 years straight, but within that time frame. And yet, riding a road bike was scary.</p>
            <p>Maybe it's because I've been riding a mountain bike all those years. For those who don't know, mountain bikes generally have thicker wheels, so it's easier to ride on different types of terrain. Road bikes have (very) thin wheels because they're meant for riding fast on flat surfaces, like roads. Can you imagine balancing your life on two wheels about as thick as your thumb?</p>
            <p>Not to mention I was riding pretty fast. Faster than I was used to anyways. Not on purpose. Road bikes are built to go fast. It's sort of like driving on the freeway for the first time. You know what to do, but the prospect of getting into an accident is pretty scary considering the fact that you're driving at such high speeds.</p>
            <p>I guess I'll have to get used to it. It's certainly a lot better than my old bike. Not just because it was a mountain bike, but because it was from Target. The main problem, for me anyways, with bikes from places like Target and Walmart is that they are heavy. Because they are built with cheap parts. They're only $200 after all.</p>
            <p>Amazing and terrifying. A pretty good combo if you ask me.</p>
            <p>6/13/2018: It took me 1 hour and 30 minutes to go 14.5 miles on my mountain bike. Google Maps estimates that it takes 1 hour and 15 minutes. I can do it in 1 hour and 5 minutes on my road bike.</p>

            <p>Love is in the air. Weaving in and out. Bobbing up and down. Hitting me and then backing off. It hurts.</p>
            <p>Is there something about spring that brings it out? Or am I breathing the wrong air in the other seasons?</p>
            <p>Actually, it's not even love. It's something though. Something's messing with me.</p>
            <p>Spring is coming to an end. So is "whatever" it is. Maybe it does have something to do with spring. Or maybe it's just the fact that the quarter is ending. I don't know if I like it, but it'll probably come back.</p>
            <p>I'll probably not be ready for it either. I've never really been good at boxing.</p>

            <p>Free guitar lessons! Participate in a paid study! Need tutoring? Anyone looking at me would've thought I was actually interested in what those flyers had to say. Huh, yeah right. There was only one paper I was interested in.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseSoundCrime">
              <p>Ah, there he is. Out of the corner of my eye, I see him leaving his room. I turn my head to look past him and stare intently at the door. The doorknob specifically. He doesn't lock it. As he turns around, I slowly turn my head back to look at the flyers. Thump, thump, thump. The wind blows by as he rushes past me. I pull out my phone and start walking towards his door.</p>
              <p>As a precaution, I knock on it. No answer. Ok, let's open it. Creeeeaaaaaaaak! Oh my god. Why didn't it make this sound when it was closing? Resisting the temptation to look behind me, I slip in.</p>
              <p>My eyes scan the room, taking note of where everything is placed. Whiteboard cleared of all writing. Chair pushed in all the way. A pile of papers neatly placed on the corner of his desk. Looks like this will be quick. I make my way over to the papers and quickly thumb through them, looking for my name. No... No... No...</p>
              <p>Thump, thump, thump. What?! Is that him?! Oh my god oh my god. What do I do what do I do? I pull out the chair, hide under his desk, and pull it back in. Creeeeaaaaaaaak! Followed by complete silence. My whole body tenses up. I stop breathing. Please don't sit down. Please don't sit down. I don't hear anything. Suddenly, his hand comes straight at me. My heart punches my chest and my eyes widen as I let out a small gasp. His hand stops for a moment, but then reaches for a briefcase next to me. He grabs the briefcase and pulls it out, his hand disappearing with it.</p>

              <p>I let out a huge sigh after he closes the door and my whole body melts into a pile of relaxation. I wait until I can't hear his footsteps anymore. Then I slowly crawl out from under the desk, as if making a sound will send him back in. I keep my eye on the door, half-expecting it to open at any moment. Thump, thump, thump. Oh my god, he's back! Quickly, I jump back under the desk, a loud bang echoing the room when I bash my knee against the table. Thump, thump, thump. Where is he?? Thump, thump, thump. Wait a minute, that's my heart. Getting out from under the desk again, I let out another huge sigh while massaging my knee and continue sifting through the papers. No... No... No... Maybe it's in the storage cabinets. I pull out the top drawer. Locked. Next one. Also locked. They were all locked.
              <p>Disappointed, but extremely relieved at not getting caught, I start to leave. I take one last look at the room behind me, searching for anything out of the ordinary. Then I open the door.</p>
              <p>Creeeeaaaaaaaak! My heart nearly explodes and I jump up as I let out a startled gasp.</p>
              <p>Another pair of eyes is staring right at me.</p>

            <h6 class="date">May 13, 2018</h6>
            <p>There's a mysterious attractiveness to her. I don't know why it's taken me so long to realize it. I guess the phrase "not immediately pretty" applies. Now that I say it, it actually sounds a bit degrading. No, she's always been pretty. What's not immediate is why. I never noticed the way her face attracts all the light in the room. Bending every wave. Redirecting every particle. Making her face glow.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseSiren">
              <p>Yet, at the same time, her face also seems to be reflecting the light. Like a mirror. Aiming the light at whomever she wants. But instead of blinding them, she casts a warm, soft glow, inviting the target to take in the beauty. And that target is me.</p>
              <p>Is it possible she's doing this on purpose? Is she somehow able to control light like this to attract anyone she wants? Am I the only one who's noticing this?</p>
              <p>Perhaps I'm being too hopeful. I mean, why me of all people? But the more I look at her, the more she seems to be redirecting the light at me. And she's doing this without looking in my direction. As if she knows that she has my attention, but wants to keep me hanging at the edge of my seat. Am I being too hopeful?</p>
              <p>Finally she looks at me. I immediately look away, the way one does when caught staring. My face feels a little warmer. I can't tell if it's because I'm getting red or because the light is getting more intense. After a moment of embarrassment, I look back at her. Is it me or is her smile a little bit bigger? Not in a devious way, but in a relieved way. It makes her face even prettier. I can't help but smile too.</p>
              <p>As I'm walking, I think about her face. The way it draws the light towards her and reflects it towards me at the same time. My heart flutters and skips a beat. I look behind me, hoping that she's around. Hoping I can see her face again.</p>
              <p>I see her.</p>
              <p>Her face is still as pretty as I last saw it. Still radiating. Still glowing. Except I don't feel the warm glow anymore. She's aiming the light at another guy. Another guy who's holding her hand. Basking in the warmth of her light. I look away, with mixed feelings in my heart. Sadness. Jealousy. A little bit of wistfulness. The world seems a bit darker without her face lighting it up. It's ok, it's not too dark. At least the sun is shining for him.</p>

            <h6 class="date">May 12, 2018</h6>
            <p>A woman is walking towards me. She looks at me. I start to open my mouth, the word "Hi" ready to jump out. Then she gives me a weird look. I close my mouth before the letter h escapes and walk past her, not saying anything. I'm confused.</p>
            <p>Oh, right. My hair. I totally forgot about my haircut. I forgot it was ugly.</p>
            <p>It's only been two weeks and, already, I feel normal. Even with the right side of my head shaved to a buzz cut and the left side mostly untouched. Actually, I feel more than normal.</p>
            <p>I feel strangely confident.</p>
            <p>Part of it is that I actually like this style. Which is weird. I don't think anyone would admit this hairstyle looks cool — much less get it. However, two people with whom I have familiarized myself have complimented it. Thank you very much. But not the response I was really looking for. I guess that makes the compliments so much more meaningful though. Perhaps there is some sort of beauty in this ugliness I have carved for myself.</p>
            <p>The other part is, I finally feel like I have some sort of defining feature that makes me stand out. Not that I cut my hair for that reason, but it is a rather nice consequence. For a good part of my life, I just wanted to not be judged. I wanted to be just another person you saw and never thought about again. I wanted to blend in wherever I went, like another brick in the wall.</p>
            <p>I never realized the light was so comforting.</p>

            <h4 class="title">Grammar Rules(!) (get it?)</h4>
            <h6 class="date">May 11, 2018</h6>
            <p>I'm a grammar Nazi. Well, ok. I used to be. If you somehow stumbled upon this website and read my other posts, you might think my grammar is a little lacking. I admit, my grasp on correct grammar rules and mechanics isn't as good as it once was.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseGrammar">
              <p>What I liked about grammar was all the rules. A comma must be placed before a conjunction separating two independent clauses. A dependent clause cannot stand alone as a sentence (incomplete sentences). A sentence cannot have more than two conjunctions separating independent clauses or predicates (run-ons). A phrase describing an object must be placed next to the object being described (dangling modifiers). The last item in a list must have an appropriate conjunction before it, like "and" or "or". A sentence shouldn't end with a preposition. That's probably my favorite.</p>
              <p>So. Many. Rules.</p>
              <p>Even the word "grammar" sounds so proper and formal doesn't it?</p>
              <p>I was born into the near-ludicrous, strict world of English. I stayed in it for years. Then I left. I no longer care about whether I should've put a comma at a certain place, or whether I'm using dashes correctly. I no longer care about maintaining consistent verb tense or a single point of view. I no longer care about forming complete sentences or cutting up run-ons. Because, in the end, it doesn't really matter for me anymore. I believe that adhering to grammar rules is a little bit inhibiting, and breaking those rules allows me to express my ideas in a much better — or at least a more interesting — way.</p>
              <p>There are some rules that shouldn't be broken though. Like subject-verb agreement. Using could've instead of could of. Eh, there aren't a lot. Or I just can't remember them right now.</p>
              <p>I'm on the fence about using the correct comparative/superlative form of an adjective. From my experience, this is probably the most common mistake both native and non-native English speakers make (as a result of the fast-paced nature of conversation). On one hand, the meaning of "more better" is totally understandable. On the other hand, "better" is <i>already</i> the correct comparative form and should actually be used instead. An even harder one to detect, especially in conversation, is using the superlative in a situation with only two objects and using the comparative with more than three.</p>
              <p>Really, the only reason why I'm writing about grammar is because I started this "free" writing. Someone, upon reviewing my previous posts, told me that I had a strong sense of grammar rules. Wait, what? My post was scattered with grammatical errors. (Or so I thought at the time. Turns out, the ones she read didn't have as much as I thought it did.)</p>
              <p>It turns out there's a general consensus that breaking rules is ok when you understand them and why you're breaking them. I don't really know if I understand why I'm breaking a rule. Does "cuz it sounds good to me" count? It's pretty much the only reason why I write anything the way it is. Like this.</p>
              <p>Do you have to be good at grammar to be a good writer? I'm not a good writer so I don't know. Part of me still thinks that content is more important. One can follow the conventions of English perfectly but write boring garbage. Another part of me thinks that wonderful ideas can lose their meaning through poorly structured sentences.</p>
              <p>A small part of me thinks, "Who cares? (sometimes "Who's reading?") This is fun. Just forget about everything and write."</p>

            <p>So you're writer's block. I was expecting something ... a little more ... well, more.</p>
            <p>I can't even see you. Not because of your size, but because you have no form. Yet I can feel your presence looming over me. Taunting me. You enjoy seeing me suffer don't you? I suppose it's because I'm a fresh target.</p>
            <p>Oh, you've been watching me ever since I could write? I wonder why I've never noticed you before then. I swear I didn't avoid you on purpose. I've heard about you, but you were just another one of those things I thought were never going to happen to me.</p>
            <p>I've done so much writing in school though. Why have you never attacked me? Is it because prompts and deadlines are barriers you can't get through? Fine, I'll admit it if you won't. They're barriers I can't get through. Give me a prompt and my imagination becomes a tightrope on which I must balance. One small step away, and I fall. Give me a deadline and my imagination quickly runs to meet it, not stopping to enjoy the scenery.</p>
            <p>Oh, that's it isn't it? You feed off of creativity don't you? You're nothing but a block filled with other people's thoughts. And now mine.</p>
            <p>I'll let you have this win. I guess I'll have to get used to your presence. Unless I stop thinking. But that's not poss—.</p>

            <p>"Where is everybody?" Said Enrico Fermi.</p>
            <p>Our universe is enormous. And very old. Yet, over the course of 14 billion years, Earth is still the only known place able to sustain life? A tiny speck in the possibly infinite expanse of space, and there's only one Earth? This is the Fermi paradox.</p>
            <p>What if aliens do exist, but they're purposely avoiding contact with us? Watching us, like we're animals at the zoo. This is the zoo hypothesis.</p>
            <p>What if, we could find another Earth, and watch how life evolves? Would we see the same thing happen on that Earth as it did on this one? Plants, animals, dinosaurs, early humans, modern-day humans. The Stone Age, the Renaissance, World War 2. The lightbulb, phone, car, computer. Religion, language, culture.</p>
            <p>Would life on that Earth go through the exact same process that life on our Earth did? Would those people make the same advancements and the same mistakes? Or did all of whatever occured on our Earth just happen by chance, and that Earth has creatures we have never seen; inventions we have never made; ideas we have never thought. What if they're aliens to us, and we're aliens to them? This is what I call the greatest experiment.</p>

            <h4 class="title">Going Against the Grain</h4>
            <h6 class="date">May 5, 2018</h6>
            <p>Have you ever held something in your hands and you know what to do with it, but you don't do it because you tell yourself you don't know how to do it?</p>
            <p>Ok, so maybe I really didn't know how to cut hair — much less my own — but I knew what I had to do with the clippers in my hand. Yet, I never put them against my head. I looked back and forth between the instructions and my head in the mirror, hoping that something in my brain would just "click" and I would suddenly know what to do. The instructions were clear enough: split your head into three sections and, starting at the bottom, cut against the grain. Yet, I never put them against my head.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseGrain">
              <p>Ironically, my somewhat-irrational fear of messing up was preventing me from cutting. Ironic, because I wanted to have an "ugly" haircut. Somewhat-irrational, because it would grow back anyways. However, the only thought going through my mind was, "Once I cut my hair off, there's no undoing it". That idea gripped my hand and held it in place, as if it was blackmailing my brain. Telling me, "Don't do it, or else".</p>
              <p>But my brain isn't always rational.</p>
              <p>Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Oh wow. I did it. I actually did it. It wasn't that bad. And it was so liberating! I felt as if I had broken off chains I didn't even know were weighing me down. In a way, I was free - free from the expectations of getting a good haircut. Free from my boring, generic, could-be-anybody look. Free from myself. I changed to a smaller guard and kept going.</p>
              <p>I actually didn't cut off a lot of hair. But it was enough to make people stare at me and wonder what happened. Which was what I wanted, in a way. Not to be some weirdo with a horrible sense of fasion or no sense of self-respect. But to be someone different.</p>
              <p>Someone new.</p>

            <h4 class="title">They Say Teaching Is the Best Way to Learn</h4>
            <h6 class="date">May 3, 2018</h6>
            <p>A few weeks ago, I read part of Habits of Mind: An Organizing Principle for Mathematics Curricula by Al Cuoco, E. Paul Goldenberg, and June Mark. They touched upon a point — or rather, centered their argument around a point — that I was slowly experiencing, but never really realized until now: math isn't really about knowing all the different shapes and their geometric properties or knowing how to do complex calculations with a ton of variables and symbols. Math is about knowing how to think.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseLearningMath">
              <p>Being a good student — or, perhaps not mutually exclusive, a blind and naive one — I never questioned what I was learning. I never asked myself, "Why do we have to know how to complete the square?" or "Why do we need to learn how to prove two triangles are congruent?". I just did them. Sure, some things are useful, like knowing how to calculate area and computing percentages, but when and how often am I ever going to be in a situation where it would be useful to know that sin(&pi;/6) is 1/2?</p>
              <p>I've been asked by high school students before, "Do you need to know this for college?" My simple answer: "No." My more accurate but perhaps not the most motivating answer: "No, I haven't done this in forever." I already know what they're thinking, even if they don't say it out loud: "Then why do we need to learn this?" My high school self would've just said, "I don't know, just do it and get it over with."</p>
              <p>For the past few days, the class for which I've been tutoring has been learning about how to prove triangles are congruent. Admittedly, I don't remember much about it. But I never realized how similar doing geometry proofs was to doing higher-level math proofs for theorems. You start with what you're given, use your knowledge to find out what else you can claim, and make your conclusions.</p>
              <p>A student asked for help proving triangles are congruent. I had no idea how to do it. I immediately started thinking, "Well, what do we know from the picture?", "Can we say this?", "Will that help?". That's when I realized that those were the types of questions they should've been asking themselves. Learning how to prove triangles are congruent isn't about making sure you know (and remember) about the side-side-side postulate or side-angle-side postulate. It's about looking at the picture and using what you know to work towards the last step in the proof. In other words, it's about learning how to think and problem solve.</p>
              <p>"Do you need to know this for college?" Probably not, at least to pass your classes anyways. I mean, you might be in a cryptography class where you have to complete the square, or you might be solving a combinatorial problem involving triangles. What's more important, I now have learned, is realizing you're learning about critical thinking — not about triangles.</p>

            <p>There's a mysterious attractiveness to her. It's not a "love-at-first-sight" sort of thing, but I can't look away no matter how hard I try. I manage to break my gaze once but it quickly makes its way back to her. She hasn't noticed me yet. And part of me is hoping that she won't.</p>
            <p>The other part of me is desperately screaming at her, trying to get her to look at me. Deep down, that part of me knows it won't work though. Not just the screaming. But the relationship as well. Or, at least that's what I tell myself.</p>
            <p>So the shy side overpowers the longing one, and I remain where I am. She never looks at me once. I feel kind of relieved, but a little wounded at the same time. I won't have to embarrass myself this time. Then her face blends into the crowd and becomes unnoticeable, the same way my face probably looks to her. I didn't know if I was ready for her to leave yet, but it was already too late.</p>
            <p>As I'm walking, I play out scenarios in my head of me approaching her and imagine how "suave" I would be in each one. My thoughts are interrupted by a finger tap on my shoulder. I look behind me, expecting no one in particular, and see her face. She's looking at me. Smiling at me.</p>
            <p>Noticing me.</p>

            <h6 class="date">April 30, 2018</h6>
            <p>I'm sitting in a chair, but I don't fit in it. It's a normal, plastic chair that an average-sized adult could sit on. It's a normal, plastic chair behind a normal-sized table in a normal-sized room. It's a normal, plastic chair.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseCulture">
              <p>It's early in the morning, and I'm in a high school classroom. If you walk into the room and look around, you would see a bunch of students. If you happened to look at me, you would think I was just another student. There was nothing about my faded blue sweater, light gray t-shirt, and coal black jeans that made me look different from everyone else. Just another student. Yet I didn't feel like I was one of them. Yeah, I was a college student tutoring at a high school. But that wasn't it. After all, I was still a student, and I had been in their shoes only 4 years ago. I was sitting in a normal, plastic chair just like they all were. The problem was, I wasn't part of their "student culture" anymore.</p>
              <p>I wasn't actually "part" of it, just around people who were. It was normal to hate school and, therefore, normal to not try in anything school-related. I get it. It's so much more fun to be talking with friends, and it's so much easier to be on our phones. It also doesn't help that everything coming out of the teacher's mouth either isn't making sense or is just plain BORING. Those people around me weren't bad people, but I could see why they wouldn't pay attention in class or skip it altogether.</p>
              <p>I'm sure everyone wasn't like that — they just chose to present themselves that way to fit in with everyone else. I mean, that's why nerds get bullied and picked on right? Pretty soon, you start hearing things like "I hate school" or "I don't wanna do this s***" and murmurs of agreement everywhere you go.</p>
              <p>At my high school, that type of student culture wasn't as harsh as I may have made it seem. Or I was just at the "wrong" place at the "wrong" time. Either way, I thought I left it behind coming into college. Selfishly, I thought to myself, "I won't have to feel uncomfortable being around those type of people ever again". But here I am now, at a high school helping students I so selfishly wanted to avoid. Ouch.</p>
              <p>Again, they weren't bad people — I just felt like I didn't belong with them.</p>
              <p>It's early in the morning, and I'm sitting in chair in a high school classroom. A normal, plastic chair behind a normal-sized table in a normal-sized room. I still don't feel quite right in it, but, this time, I feel slightly more comfortable. Because next to me, is another student who, although he doesn't like school, is at least willing to try.</p>
              <p>When I get out of my chair, I look back, and I see something strange in the corner of my eye. The chair looks different. Then I blink and everything is back to normal. I'm probably imagining things. After all, I probably would've noticed if I was sitting on a cushion the whole time.</p>

            <p>What is a function? Those of you familiar with programming might say that a function is a piece of code that is reused throughout your code to perform a task. Those of you thinking in terms of higher-level math might define it as a mapping from a set to another set. Those of you more comfortable with lower-level math might describe it as ... well, I'm not sure actually.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseFunction">
              <p>I remember being asked this question at an interview. It was for a tutoring position where I would have to help children with programming. So I had to explain what a function was so that a child could understand.</p>
              <p>This question — a rubber ball to the prepared and a spear to those who weren't — was thrown at me. Its sharp point grazed my brain. My brain stopped for a few seconds in shock, realizing what could've happened if it had been thrown a few more millimeters to the side. I had been programming with functions for 2 years and I still didn't know what they were?! My brain started running around in circles. It fell, got back up, started running, fell again, got back up again, started running again, ... When it finally stopped to rest, it came up with "a function is something that takes in an input, does something with it, and returns an output".</p>
              <p>Not the best answer, but the best I could come up with in such a short amount of time. After saying it, I immediately thought of functions with no parameters and void signatures (functions with no input and no output). But that wasn't the main issue with my answer. My answer was no better than telling you that a function is something that does something.</p>
              <p>I didn't get the position, which was no surprise to me. It wasn't just that question that killed my chances, but that's a different story. That spear left a lasting impression on me that still hurts to this day. How many concepts have I been using for a long time without thinking about what they were?</p>
              <p>How many of those do I actually know how to explain?</p>

            <p>I've never fancied myself a great writer. Or even a writer, for that matter. In fact, I don't even know why I'm writing this. Not just this post, but this sentence.</p>
            <p>This word.</p>
            <p>This letter.</p>
            <p>Letter. Maybe that's it. Maybe I'm just writing a letter and mailing it to no one in particular. Maybe someone will open their mailbox and find this letter waiting to be opened and read. Or maybe it will get lost in the mail and never be read.</p>
            <p>I suppose this would be the beginning of this blog-ish page. The problem with the beginning is you never know what's at the end or what you might find along the way. Perhaps that's not such a bad thing. But does the road through the beginning always have to be such a long and difficult one? There are no other roads and I've already come this far. So I might as well just keep going. Who knows? This might turn out to be a fun adventure.</p>
