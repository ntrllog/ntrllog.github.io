            <p>Theorem: There are `2^n` subsets of a set of size `n`</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="subsetinduction">
              <p>Let `P(n)` be the statement that there are `2^n` subsets of a set of size `n`</p>
              <p>For a set with `0` elements, the only subset is `O/`, which is consistent with `2^0 = 1` so `P(0)` is true</p>
              <p>Suppose `P(n)` is true. Want to show `P(n+1)` is true, i.e. there are `2^(n+1)` subsets of a set of size `n+1`</p>
              <p>Let `S` be a set of size `n+1`</p>
              <p>Fix any `x in S` and consider `S' = S\\{x}`</p>
              <p>Since `S'` has `n` elements, there are `2^n` subsets</p>
              <p>Every subset of `S` either contains `x` or it doesn't contain `x`</p>
              <p>The subsets that don't contain `x` are in `S'`, which has `2^n` subsets</p>
              <p>So there are `2^n` subsets that don't contain `x`</p>
              <p>The subsets that do contain `x` can be obtained by adding `x` to each subset that doesn't contain `x`</p>
              <p>So there are `2^n` subsets that do contain `x`</p>
              <p>The total number of subsets of `S` is the number of subsets containing `x` plus the number of the subsets not containing `x`</p>
              <p>So the total number of subsets of `S` is `2^n + 2^n = 2^(n+1)`</p>

          <p>Let's suppose you're arranging flowers. You have `2` red flowers and `1` yellow flower. How many ways can we arrange them? Previously, we saw that if we have `n` elements, there are `n!` ways to arrange them. Here, we have `3` elements, so there are `3! = 6` ways to arrange them. All the possible orderings are:</p>
