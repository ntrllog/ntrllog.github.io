      <h4 class="title">The Beginning</h4>
      <h6 class="date">April 28, 2018</h6>
      <p>I've never fancied myself a great writer. Or even a writer, for that matter. In fact, I don't even know why I'm writing this. Not just this post, but this sentence. This word. This letter. Letter. Maybe that's it. Maybe I'm just writing a letter and mailing it to no one in particular. Maybe someone will open their mailbox and find this letter waiting to be opened and read. Or maybe it will get lost in the mail and never be read.</p>
      <p>I suppose this would be the beginning of this "blog". The problem with the beginning is you never know what's at the end or what you might find along the way. Perhaps that's not such a bad thing. But does the road through the beginning always have to be such a long and difficult one? There are no other roads and I've already come this far. So I might as well just keep going. Who knows? This might turn out to be a fun adventure.</p>

      <h4 class="title">The Function Of a Function And How They Function</h4>
      <h6 class="date">April 29, 2018</h6>
      <p>What is a function? Those of you familiar with programming might say that a function is a piece of code that is reused throughout your code to perform a task. Those of you thinking in terms of higher-level math might define it as a mapping from a set to another set. Those of you more comfortable with lower-level math might describe it as ... well, I'm not sure actually.</p>
      <p>I remember being asked this question at an interview. It was for a tutoring position where I would have to help children with programming. So I had to explain what a function was so that a child could understand. This question was thrown at me like a spear and it grazed my brain. It stopped for a few seconds in shock, realizing what could've happened if the spear had been thrown a few more millimeters to the side. I had been programming with functions for 2 years and I still didn't know what they were!? My brain started running around in circles. It fell then got back up then started running then fell again then got back up again then started running again... When it finally stopped to rest, it came up with "a function is something that takes in an input, does something with it, and returns an output".</p>
      <p>Not the best answer, but the best I could come up with in such a short amount of time. After saying it, I realized I was not satisfied with it, but it was too late. After saying it, I immediately thought of functions with no parameters and void signatures (functions with no input and no output). But that wasn't the main issue with my answer. My answer was no better than telling you that a function is something that does something.</p>
      <p>I didn't get the position, which was no surprise to me. It wasn't just that question that killed my chances, but that's a different story. That spear left a lasting impression on me that still hurts to this day. How many concepts have I been using for a long time without thinking about what they were?</p>
      <p>How many of those do I actually know how to explain?</p>
